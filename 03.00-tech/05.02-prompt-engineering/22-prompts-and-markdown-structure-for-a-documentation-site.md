## 📝 Prompt Files for Task Automation

Prompt files are the backbone of an AI-enhanced documentation workflow. Each prompt automates a specific task, making it easy to maintain quality and consistency across your documentation site. Store these files in `.github/prompts/` for automatic recognition by both VS Code and Visual Studio.

### Content Generation Prompts

**Article Writing (`article-writing.prompt.md`)**  
Generates complete draft articles from a topic and outline. This prompt leverages `#fetch` to retrieve authoritative sources and research, enriching the content with verified information. It follows your article templates to ensure structural consistency and includes proper metadata initialization.

### Quality Validation Prompts

**Grammar Review (`grammar-review.prompt.md`)**  
Performs comprehensive grammar, spelling, and punctuation checks. This prompt identifies errors, suggests corrections, and updates the article's embedded validation metadata with results. It implements validation caching to avoid redundant checks on unchanged content.

**Readability & Redundancy Review (`readability-review.prompt.md`)**  
Evaluates writing clarity, consistency, and flow. It calculates readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid), identifies redundant content, checks terminology consistency, and suggests improvements for better comprehension. Results are tracked in the article's embedded metadata.

**Understandability Review (`understandability-review.prompt.md`)**  
Assesses whether content effectively communicates to the target audience. This prompt evaluates concept clarity, identifies assumption gaps, checks progressive complexity, and ensures examples support explanations appropriately for the intended reader level.

**Structure Validation (`structure-validation.prompt.md`)**  
Verifies articles contain all required components: table of contents, introduction, proper heading hierarchy, conclusion, references section, and embedded metadata. It ensures compliance with your documentation templates and standards.

**Facts Checking (`fact-checking.prompt.md`)**  
Validates factual accuracy against authoritative sources. This prompt identifies claims requiring verification, checks information currency, validates citations, and confirms that references actually support stated facts. It uses `#fetch` to retrieve and verify source content.

**Logic Analysis (`logic-analysis.prompt.md`)**  
Examines logical flow and conceptual connections throughout articles. It checks whether ideas build coherently, concepts are introduced before use, transitions are smooth, and no logical leaps exist. This ensures articles follow sound pedagogical structure.

### Analysis and Discovery Prompts

**Gap Analysis (`gap-analysis.prompt.md`)**  
Identifies missing information by comparing article content to authoritative sources. It discovers omitted concepts, unexplained prerequisites, common reader questions not addressed, and related topics that should be linked or covered.

**Series Validation (`series-validation.prompt.md`)**  
Reviews multiple related articles to ensure logical progression, consistent terminology, appropriate cross-referencing, and non-redundancy. This prompt is essential for multi-part tutorials or article series, maintaining coherence across the entire collection.

**Correlated Subjects Discovery (`correlated-topics.prompt.md`)**  
Suggests related topics, prerequisite knowledge, and advanced follow-up subjects based on article content. It helps build comprehensive learning paths by identifying connections between topics and discovering content opportunities.

### Prompt Configuration Features

Each prompt can leverage powerful IDE features:
- **VS Code**: Use `\${input:...}\` variables for parameters, `#fetch` for web content retrieval, `#codebase` for repository searches, and `#file` for specific file references
- **Visual Studio** (v17.10+): Trigger prompts via `#promptName` syntax and use `#file` references for content specification
- **Model Selection**: Configure preferred AI models (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `gpt-4o`) in prompt frontmatter
- **Agent Modes**: Specify `agent: ask` for analysis, `agent: edit` for direct modifications, or `agent: agent` for complex workflows

## 📋 Template Files for Consistent Structure

Templates ensure uniformity across your documentation site. Maintain these in `.github/templates/` for easy reference by both humans and AI assistants.

### Article Templates

**`article-template.md`**  
Defines the standard article structure including dual YAML blocks (Quarto metadata at top, Article additional metadata in HTML comment at bottom), title, introduction, table of contents, body sections with proper heading hierarchy, conclusion, and references section. This template serves as the blueprint for all educational content.

**`howto-template.md`**  
Specialized structure for procedural guides, emphasizing step-by-step instructions, prerequisites section, expected outcomes, troubleshooting tips, and verification steps. Ideal for tutorials and how-to guides.

**`tutorial-template.md`**  
Long-form instructional content template with learning objectives, prerequisite knowledge, hands-on exercises, checkpoint validations, and next steps for continued learning.

### Workflow Templates

**`issue-template.md`**  
Standardized format for reporting problems, tracking discrepancies, or suggesting improvements. Includes sections for description, reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, context information, and resolution tracking.

**`recording-summary-template.md`**  
Structure for documenting recorded sessions, interviews, or presentations. Includes metadata (date, participants, duration), segment summaries with timestamps, key points extraction, and action items.

**`recording-analysis-template.md`**  
Deeper analysis framework for recorded content, identifying themes, patterns, unanswered questions, insights, and follow-up research directions.

## 📚 Context and Instruction Files

Context files guide AI assistants to produce higher-quality, more consistent outputs aligned with your editorial standards and domain knowledge.

### Global Instructions

**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**  
Your site's editorial constitution. This file codifies universal standards such as:
- Cross-verification of facts with authoritative sources
- Citation requirements for all claims
- Readability targets (sentence length, grade level)
- Required article structure (TOC, introduction, conclusion, references)
- Dual metadata block architecture rules
- Validation caching policies

These instructions apply automatically in VS Code and Visual Studio (v17.10+) when "Use Instruction Files" is enabled. They influence every AI interaction within your workspace.

### Scoped Instructions

**`.github/instructions/`**  
File- or directory-specific guidelines that override or extend global instructions. Examples:

**`documentation.instructions.md`** (applies to `**/*.md`)  
Enforces Markdown style rules, heading conventions, link formatting, and code block standards across all documentation.

**`prompts.instructions.md`** (applies to `tech/PromptEngineering/**/*.md`)  
Specialized rules for prompt engineering content, emphasizing practical examples, tool-specific guidance, and version-specific feature documentation.

**`tech-articles.instructions.md`** (applies to `tech/**/*.md`)  
Technical accuracy requirements, code example standards, version specification mandates, and security consideration checklists for technical content.

### Extended Context Materials

**`.copilot/context/`**  
Supporting materials that enhance AI understanding of your domain and standards:

**`02-dual-yaml-metadata.md`**  
Complete guide to parsing and updating dual YAML metadata blocks, including code examples, schemas, and validation rules.

**`validation-schemas.md`**  
Detailed schemas for all validation types (grammar, readability, facts, logic, structure, understandability) with expected outcomes and metrics.

**`glossary.md`**  
Domain-specific terminology definitions ensuring consistent usage across all content.

**`style-guide.md`**  
Writing conventions, formatting standards, and editorial preferences specific to your documentation site.

GitHub Copilot's semantic search prioritizes content in `.copilot/context/`, making this directory highly effective for storing reference materials that should influence AI outputs.

## 🏷️ Article Metadata Management

Effective metadata tracking enables validation caching, prevents redundant AI calls, and maintains audit trails of content quality checks.

### Dual YAML Block Architecture

This repository implements a dual metadata system that separates concerns while keeping all data with the article:

**Top YAML Block (Quarto Metadata)**  
Standard frontmatter at the file beginning with `---` delimiters:
```yaml
---
title: "Prompts and Markdown Structure for a Documentation Site"
author: "Dario Airoldi"
date: "2025-11-23"
categories: [prompt engineering, documentation, workflow]
description: "Comprehensive guide to organizing prompt files, templates, and metadata for AI-enhanced documentation sites"
---
```

This block contains document properties used by Quarto for site generation and is modified manually by authors.

**Bottom HTML Comment Block (Article Additional Metadata)**  
Embedded at the file end within HTML comment tags for complete invisibility in rendered output:
```markdown
<!--

```

This block is managed by validation prompts and tools, never by manual editing or document rendering systems.

### Embedded Metadata Benefits

**Atomicity**: Article and its validation history travel together. No orphaned metadata files when articles are moved or renamed.

**Invisibility**: HTML comments are completely hidden in rendered output, keeping reader-facing content clean.

**Automatic Sync**: Tools like IQPilot automatically update `article_metadata.filename` when articles are renamed, maintaining perfect synchronization.

**Validation Caching**: Prompts check `last_run` timestamps and content hashes to skip redundant validations, reducing AI API costs by 80-90%.

**Audit Trail**: Complete history of quality checks, models used, and outcomes provides accountability and continuous improvement insights.

**Single Source of Truth**: No confusion about which metadata file corresponds to which article or whether metadata is current.

## 🎯 Implementation Best Practices

**Start with Templates**: When creating new content, always begin with the appropriate template from `.github/templates/`. Templates include pre-initialized metadata blocks and proper structure.

**Enable Instruction Files**: In VS Code settings or Visual Studio options, enable "Use Instruction Files" to automatically apply editorial standards from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and scoped instructions.

**Leverage Validation Caching**: Run validation prompts incrementally as you edit. Prompts check timestamps and skip unnecessary work, making frequent validation checks cost-effective.

**Maintain Context Materials**: Keep `.copilot/context/` updated with current standards, schemas, and domain knowledge. This directory has high semantic search priority.

**Use Consistent Naming**: Follow naming conventions for prompt files (`task-name.prompt.md`), templates (`type-template.md`), and instruction files (`scope.instructions.md`).

**Document Custom Prompts**: When creating specialized prompts, include clear frontmatter describing the prompt's purpose, required inputs, and expected outputs.

**Version Control Metadata**: Track changes to embedded metadata blocks in git to understand content evolution and validation history over time.

**Regular Metadata Review**: Periodically check articles for outdated validations (e.g., facts checked more than 30 days ago, grammar not checked in 7+ days) and re-run appropriate prompts.
