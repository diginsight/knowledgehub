# How to Optimize Prompts for Specific Models

A <mark>**"good generic prompt" doesn't exist**</mark>—there exists only a <mark>**good prompt for that specific model**</mark>.

This principle, emphasized in Mario Fontana's "6 VITAL Rules for Production-Ready Copilot Agents," forms the foundation of professional prompt engineering. Different models have fundamentally different behaviors, sensitivities, and optimal prompting strategies. What works brilliantly with Claude may fail with GPT-4o; what excels with Gemini may confuse reasoning models.

This article synthesizes the <mark>official prompting guides</mark> from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to provide actionable, model-specific optimization techniques. For detailed analysis of each provider's guide, see the appendix articles linked at the end.

# 🎯 Why Model-Specific Prompting Matters

## The Compiler Analogy

Think of each model as a <mark>**different compiler**</mark>.  
The same "source code" (your prompt) produces different "executables" (responses) depending on which compiler processes it.  
Just as you wouldn't expect C++ code to compile identically on GCC and MSVC without adjustments, you shouldn't expect the same prompt to perform identically across GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini.

## What Changes Between Models

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **<mark>Sensitivity to constraints</mark>** | Some models follow explicit constraints <mark>rigidly</mark>; others interpret them <mark>flexibly</mark> |
| **<mark>Ambiguity handling</mark>** | Models differ in whether they <mark>ask for clarification</mark> or <mark>make assumptions</mark> |
| **<mark>Response patterns</mark>** | Default <mark>verbosity</mark>, formatting preferences, and structure vary significantly |
| **<mark>Token interpretation</mark>** | <mark>Context window utilization</mark>, <mark>attention patterns</mark>, and <mark>recency bias</mark> differ |
| **<mark>Chain of thought</mark>** | Some models benefit from <mark>explicit CoT prompting</mark>; others (reasoning models) do it internally |

## The Rule (Simple but Often Ignored)

<mark>**Every time you change model or version:**</mark>

1. ✅ **Read the official prompt guide** for that specific model
2. ✅ **Connect model change to test pipeline** updated with latest official guide
3. ✅ **Re-validate** existing prompts against the new model's behavior

> **Source:** This rule comes from Mario Fontana's "6 VITAL Rules for Production-Ready Copilot Agents" - Rule 6: Model-Specific Prompt Optimization.

# 📊 Model Family Comparison

| Model | Provider | Best For | Context Window | Key Behavior | Prompt Style |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **<mark>GPT-4o</mark> / <mark>GPT-4.1</mark>** | OpenAI | General tasks, code generation | 128K | Fast, balanced, highly steerable | Explicit instructions, few-shot examples |
| **<mark>GPT-5</mark> / <mark>GPT-5.2</mark>** | OpenAI | Complex tasks, broad domains | 1M+ | Latest capabilities, vision | Precise developer messages, Markdown/XML |
| **<mark>o3</mark> / <mark>o4-mini</mark>** | OpenAI | Complex reasoning, planning | 200K | Internal chain of thought | Simple prompts, high-level goals |
| **<mark>Claude Sonnet 4</mark>** | Anthropic | Long documents, nuanced analysis | 200K | Thoughtful, cautious, detailed | XML tags, clear context, CoT when needed |
| **<mark>Claude with Extended Thinking</mark>** | Anthropic | Complex STEM, constraint problems | 200K | Deep internal reasoning | High-level instructions, let model think |
| **<mark>Gemini 2.0 Flash</mark>** | Google | Fast inference, multimodal | 1M+ | Quick responses, visual reasoning | Clear structure, few-shot examples |
| **<mark>Gemini 3</mark>** | Google | Advanced reasoning, agentic tasks | Context varies | Strong instruction following | Direct prompts, XML/Markdown structure |

# 🧠 Understanding Model Categories

## <mark>Standard Language Models</mark> (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, Gemini)

These models benefit from <mark>**explicit, detailed instructions**</mark>:

- ✅ Provide step-by-step guidance
- ✅ Use few-shot examples liberally
- ✅ Explicitly state constraints and output formats
- ✅ Use chain-of-thought prompting when reasoning is needed

## <mark>Reasoning Models</mark> (o3, o4-mini, Claude Extended Thinking)

These models perform <mark>**internal reasoning before responding**</mark>:

- ✅ Give high-level goals, not step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Trust the model to work out details
- ❌ **Avoid** "think step by step" prompts—they already do this internally
- ✅ Be specific about success criteria and constraints

> **Key Insight:** A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker—you give them goals. A standard model is like a junior coworker—they need explicit instructions.

# 🔧 <mark>GPT Models</mark>: Explicit Instruction Optimization

GPT models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5) benefit from <mark>**precise instructions**</mark> that explicitly provide the logic and data required to complete the task.

## Core Prompting Structure

Use **<mark>developer messages</mark>** (formerly <mark>system messages</mark>) to establish identity, instructions, examples, and context:

```markdown
# Identity
You are a [role] specializing in [domain].

# Instructions
* [Specific rule 1]
* [Specific rule 2]
* [What to do / not do]

# Examples
<user_query>
[Example input]
</user_query>
<assistant_response>
[Example output]
</assistant_response>

# Context
[Any additional information needed for this request]
```

## Key Techniques

### 1. Message Roles and Authority

| Role | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `developer` | Application rules and business logic | Highest |
| `user` | End-user inputs and configuration | Lower |
| `assistant` | Model-generated responses | — |

### 2. Markdown and XML Formatting

Use clear delimiters to mark sections:

```markdown
# Identity
You are a security auditor for REST APIs.

# Instructions
- Review the provided API code for vulnerabilities
- Output findings as a numbered list
- Do not include markdown code blocks in your response

<api_code>
[User's code here]
</api_code>
```

### 3. Few-Shot Learning

Provide 2-5 diverse examples showing input/output pairs:

```markdown
# Examples

<review id="example-1">
I love this product!
</review>
<classification id="example-1">
Positive
</classification>

<review id="example-2">
Battery is okay, but feels cheap.
</review>
<classification id="example-2">
Neutral
</classification>
```

### 4. Prompt Caching Optimization

Place **static content first** in your prompts to maximize caching savings:

```markdown
# [Static instructions - cached]
# [Static examples - cached]
# [Dynamic context - varies per request]
```

> **Deep Dive:** See [08.01 OpenAI Models Prompting Guide Analysis](./08.01-appendix_openai_prompting_guide.md) for comprehensive GPT optimization techniques.

# 💜 Claude Models: <mark>Clarity</mark> and <mark>Context Optimization</mark>

Claude models excel with <mark>**clear, contextual, and well-structured prompts**</mark>. Think of Claude as a brilliant but new employee who needs explicit context about your norms and preferences.

## The Golden Rule

> <mark>Show your prompt to a colleague with minimal context</mark> on the task. => <mark>If they're confused, Claude will likely be too.</mark>

## Core Prompting Structure

Claude responds exceptionally well to **XML tags** for structure:

```xml
<role>
You are a technical documentation specialist.
</role>

<context>
You are reviewing API documentation for a REST service.
</context>

<instructions>
1. Check for completeness of endpoint descriptions
2. Verify all parameters are documented
3. Flag missing error response codes
</instructions>

<output_format>
Return findings as a markdown table with columns:
Endpoint | Issue | Severity | Recommendation
</output_format>
```

## Key Techniques

### 1. <mark>Chain of Thought</mark> (Standard Claude)

For complex tasks, use structured CoT with XML tags:

```xml
<task>
Analyze this financial report and identify risks.
</task>

<thinking>
[Claude's reasoning process will appear here]
</thinking>

<answer>
[Final structured response]
</answer>
```

### 2. <mark>Extended Thinking</mark> Mode

When using extended thinking, <mark>**give high-level instructions**</mark> rather than step-by-step guidance:

```markdown
Please think about this problem thoroughly and in great detail.
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
```

❌ **Avoid** over-prescribing the thinking process—Claude's creativity may exceed your ability to prescribe the optimal approach.

### 3. <mark>Long Context Tips</mark>

- Place critical instructions at the **beginning** of prompts
- Use XML tags to clearly delineate document sections
- For very long documents, provide a brief summary of what to look for

### 4. <mark>Multishot Prompting</mark>

Claude generalizes well from examples:

```markdown
I'll show you how to classify support tickets:

<ticket id="1">
I can't log in to my account
</ticket>
<classification id="1">
authentication
</classification>

<ticket id="2">
My payment was charged twice
</ticket>
<classification id="2">
billing
</classification>

Now classify this ticket:
<ticket id="new">
{{user_ticket}}
</ticket>
```

> **Deep Dive:** See [08.02 Claude Models Prompting Guide Analysis](./08.02-appendix_anthropic_prompting_guide.md) for comprehensive Claude optimization techniques.

# 🔷 Gemini Models: Structured Prompting Optimization

Gemini models respond best to <mark>**clear, structured prompts with consistent formatting**</mark>. Gemini 3 in particular excels at instruction following when prompts are well-organized.

## Core Prompting Structure

Use either XML tags or Markdown headers consistently:

**XML Style:**
```xml
<role>
You are a senior solution architect.
</role>

<constraints>
- No external libraries allowed
- Python 3.11+ syntax only
</constraints>

<task>
Design a caching layer for the provided API.
</task>

<output_format>
Return a single code block with comments.
</output_format>
```

**Markdown Style:**
```markdown
# Identity
You are a senior solution architect.

# Constraints
- No external libraries allowed
- Python 3.11+ syntax only

# Output format
Return a single code block.
```

## Key Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot

Gemini often performs well with **zero-shot** prompts, but few-shot examples help when you need specific output formats:

```markdown
Valid fields are cheeseburger, hamburger, fries, and drink.

Order: Give me a cheeseburger and fries
Output:
{"cheeseburger": 1, "fries": 1}

Order: I want two burgers, a drink, and fries.
Output:
```

### 2. Completion Strategy

Let Gemini complete partial outputs to control format:

```markdown
Create an outline for an essay about hummingbirds.

I. Introduction
*
```

Gemini will continue the established pattern.

### 3. Context Anchoring

After providing large context blocks, use transition phrases:

```markdown
<documents>
[Large amount of reference material]
</documents>

Based on the information above, answer the following question:
[Your specific query]
```

### 4. Gemini 3 Specific Tips

For Gemini 3 models:

- **Be precise and direct**—avoid unnecessary language
- **Control verbosity explicitly**—Gemini 3 defaults to concise responses
- **Prioritize critical instructions**—place at the beginning
- **Handle multimodal inputs coherently**—treat text and images as equal inputs

> **Deep Dive:** See [08.03 Gemini Models Prompting Guide Analysis](./08.03-appendix_google_prompting_guide.md) for comprehensive Gemini optimization techniques.

# ⚡ <mark>Reasoning Models</mark>: <mark>Minimal Guidance</mark> Optimization

Reasoning models (<mark>OpenAI o3/o4-mini</mark>, <mark>Claude Extended Thinking</mark>) use <mark>**internal chain of thought**</mark> before responding. They require fundamentally different prompting.

## Core Differences from Standard Models

| Aspect | Standard Models | Reasoning Models |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **<mark>Instruction style</mark>** | Detailed, step-by-step | High-level goals |
| **<mark>Chain of thought</mark>** | Must be prompted explicitly | Happens internally |
| **<mark>"Think step by step"</mark>** | Helpful | Unnecessary/harmful |
| **<mark>Few-shot examples</mark>** | Often required | Try zero-shot first |
| **<mark>Constraints</mark>** | Embedded in instructions | Specify success criteria |

## When to Use Reasoning Models

✅ **Use for:**
- Complex multi-step planning
- Ambiguous tasks requiring interpretation
- Large document analysis (needle in haystack)
- Nuanced decision-making with many factors
- Code review and debugging
- Scientific and mathematical reasoning

❌ **Avoid for:**
- Simple, well-defined tasks (use GPT instead)
- Latency-sensitive applications
- High-volume, low-complexity requests

## Prompting Reasoning Models

### OpenAI o3/o4-mini

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},  # low, medium, or high
    input=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "You are a tax research specialist."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Analyze how this fundraise affects existing shareholders with anti-dilution privileges."
        }
    ]
)
```

**Key settings:**
- `reasoning.effort`: Controls reasoning depth (low = faster, high = more thorough)
- Use `developer` messages for high-level guidance
- Reserve at least 25,000 tokens for reasoning and output

### Claude Extended Thinking

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20260514",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Design an optimal algorithm for this constraint satisfaction problem..."
    }]
)
```

**Key settings:**
- Start with minimum budget (1024 tokens) and increase as needed
- Don't prefill assistant responses
- Ask Claude to verify its work with test cases

## Multi-Model Reasoning Architecture

Combine reasoning and standard models for optimal results:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  o3 (Planner)                                               │
│  └── Analyzes task, creates multi-step plan                 │
│      └── Assigns subtasks to appropriate models             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ├──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
         ▼                  ▼                  ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ GPT-4o      │    │ Claude      │    │ GPT-4o      │
│ (Subtask 1) │    │ (Long doc)  │    │ (Subtask 3) │
│ Fast exec   │    │ 200K ctx    │    │ Code gen    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

# 🏗️ Multi-Model Architecture Patterns

Production systems often benefit from using <mark>**different models for different tasks**</mark> within the same workflow.

## Pattern 1: Planner + Executors

```
User Request
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Reasoning Model (o3)    │  ← Planning: Analyze request, decompose into steps
│ "The Planner"           │
└─────────────────────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ GPT-4o / Claude         │  ← Execution: Fast, cost-effective task completion
│ "The Workhorses"        │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## Pattern 2: Task-Specific Model Selection

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Main agent orchestration | GPT-4o | Fast, balanced, reliable |
| Long document analysis | Claude Sonnet 4 | 200K context, strong comprehension |
| Complex reasoning decisions | o3/o4-mini | Internal chain of thought |
| Code generation | GPT-4o / Claude | Fast, accurate code output |
| Multimodal (image + text) | Gemini 2.0 / GPT-4o | Strong vision capabilities |
| Evaluation/grading | o3 | Nuanced judgment, high accuracy |

## Pattern 3: Model-Specific Reviewers

Create dedicated reviewer agents optimized for each model you use:

```yaml
# .github/agents/openai-prompt-reviewer.agent.md
---
name: openai-prompt-reviewer
description: Reviews prompts for GPT model optimization
model: gpt-4o
---

# OpenAI Prompt Reviewer

Review prompts for GPT-4o/GPT-5 optimization:
- Check for explicit developer message structure
- Verify few-shot examples are included
- Ensure Markdown/XML formatting is consistent
- Validate prompt caching optimization
```

# 📋 Model Selection Decision Framework

Use this flowchart to select the right model for your task:

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
                    │ What's your top priority?│
                    └──────────────────────────┘
                               │
          ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
          ▼                    ▼                    ▼
    ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
    │ Speed &  │        │ Accuracy &   │     │ Long Context │
    │ Cost     │        │ Reliability  │     │ (>100K)      │

              │ Yes      │          │ No       │
              │ → o3     │          │ → GPT-4o │
              └──────────┘          └──────────┘
```

# 🧪 Testing Prompts Across Models

When changing models or versions, <mark>**always re-test your prompts**</mark>.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Create Model-Specific Test Suites

```markdown
# test-prompt-openai.md
Model: gpt-4o
Prompt: [Your prompt]
Expected: [Expected output characteristics]
Actual: [Results]
Pass/Fail: ___
```

### 2. Use Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Does the output match expected results?
- **Format compliance**: Does output follow specified structure?
- **Constraint adherence**: Are all constraints respected?
- **Latency**: Response time within acceptable limits?
- **Cost**: Token usage within budget?

### 3. Leverage AI for Prompt Review

Ask Copilot to review your prompt for model compatibility:

```
Review this prompt for GPT-4o optimization:
[Your prompt]

Check for:
- Explicit instruction clarity
- Few-shot example quality
- Markdown/XML structure
- Missing constraints
```

### 4. Automate with Agent Reviewers

Create automated reviewer agents for each model family (see Pattern 3 in Multi-Model Architecture).

# 🎯 Conclusion

Model-specific prompting is <mark>**not optional for production systems**</mark>. Each model family has distinct behaviors that require tailored optimization:

| Model Family | Key Optimization Strategy |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **GPT (4o, 5)** | Explicit instructions, few-shot examples, developer messages |
| **Claude** | XML structure, clear context, CoT for complex tasks |
| **Gemini** | Consistent formatting, completion patterns, structured prompts |
| **Reasoning (o3, Extended Thinking)** | High-level goals, minimal guidance, trust internal reasoning |

**Remember:**
1. Read the official prompting guide for every model you use
2. Re-test prompts when changing models or versions
3. Use multi-model architectures to leverage each model's strengths
4. Create model-specific reviewer agents for automated validation
