# FINAL SOLUTION: No Artifacts Approach

## 🔴 The Real Problem

You're absolutely right! The split-job approach I initially suggested **still uses artifacts**, which means:
- ❌ Still counts against your storage quota
- ❌ Can still hit quota limits if workflow runs frequently
- ❌ Only reduces the problem, doesn't solve it

## ✅ The Real Solution: ZERO Artifacts

You need a workflow that **doesn't use artifacts at all**. Here are your options:

## 🎯 Recommended Solution Options

### **Option 1: Use Quarto's Built-in Publish** ⭐ **EASIEST & BEST**

**File**: `quarto-publish.simple.yml`

**How it works:**
```
Render → Push directly to gh-pages branch
(No artifacts, no GitHub Actions Pages system)
```

**Command:**
```bash
quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt --no-browser
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **ZERO artifacts** - No storage quota used
- ✅ Simplest solution - One command does everything
- ✅ Official Quarto method
- ✅ Works natively on Windows
- ✅ Handles all git operations automatically

**Cons:**
- Uses `contents: write` permission (needs to push to gh-pages branch)

**GitHub Pages Setup Required:**
- Go to: Settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: `gh-pages` / `root`

---

### **Option 2: Manual Git Push to gh-pages** ⭐ **FULL CONTROL**

**File**: `quarto-publish.direct.yml`

**How it works:**
```
Render → Manually push docs to gh-pages branch
(No artifacts, custom deployment logic)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **ZERO artifacts**
- ✅ Full control over deployment process
- ✅ Works natively on Windows
- ✅ Can customize deployment logic

**Cons:**
- More complex workflow script
- More git commands to maintain

---

### **Option 3: Current Approach (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**File**: `quarto-publish.win64.yml` (current)

**Problems:**
- ❌ Uses `upload-artifact@v4` (counts against quota!)
- ❌ Creates artifact on every run
- ❌ Even with 1-day retention, can accumulate if you run frequently
- ❌ This is what's causing your quota issue

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Approach | Artifacts Used? | Quota Impact | Works on Windows? | Complexity |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Quarto built-in** | ❌ None | ✅ Zero | ✅ Yes | ⭐ Simple |
| **Manual gh-pages push** | ❌ None | ✅ Zero | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Split job (current)** | ✅ Yes (1 day) | ⚠️ Low but not zero | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Single job with Pages API** | ✅ Yes | ❌ High | ❌ Needs WSL | ⭐⭐⭐ Complex |

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### To Use Option 1 (Quarto Built-in - RECOMMENDED):

1. **Disable current workflow:**
   ```powershell
   # Rename to disable it
   cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn\.github\workflows"
   Rename-Item "quarto-publish.win64.yml" "quarto-publish.win64.yml.disabled"
   ```

2. **Enable the simple workflow:**
   ```powershell
   # It's already created as quarto-publish.simple.yml
   # Just commit and push
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/darioairoldi/Learn/settings/pages
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **gh-pages** / **root**
   - Save

4. **Commit and test:**
   ```powershell
   cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn"
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Switch to Quarto built-in publish (no artifacts)"
   git push
   ```

---

## 🎯 Why Quarto Built-in is Best

The `quarto publish gh-pages` command is specifically designed for this use case:

```yaml
# This ONE command does everything:
quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt --no-browser
```

**What it does internally:**
1. Renders your Quarto project
2. Creates/updates the `gh-pages` branch
3. Pushes the rendered content
4. All without using any GitHub Actions artifacts!

**It's literally the official way to publish Quarto to GitHub Pages.**

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Up After Switch

After switching to the no-artifact approach:

1. **Run the cleanup script** to remove existing artifacts:
   ```powershell
   cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn\20251018-issue-github-action-fails-with-artifact-storage-quota-has-been-hit"
   .\cleanup-artifacts.ps1
   ```

2. **Monitor that no new artifacts are created:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/darioairoldi/Learn/actions/artifacts
   - Should remain empty after workflows run

---

## 📝 Quick Decision Guide

**Use Quarto Built-in (`quarto-publish.simple.yml`) if:**
- ✅ You want the simplest solution
- ✅ You're okay with `quarto publish` handling everything
- ✅ You want the official Quarto method
- ✅ You want ZERO artifacts

**Use Manual Push (`quarto-publish.direct.yml`) if:**
- ✅ You need custom deployment logic
- ✅ You want more control over the git operations
- ✅ You want ZERO artifacts

**Don't use the split-job approach if:**
- ❌ You're hitting artifact storage quota limits
- ❌ You run workflows frequently
- ❌ You want to avoid artifacts completely

---

## ✅ Summary

**The issue with the current approach:**
- Still uses artifacts (even with 1-day retention)
- Can accumulate if workflow runs frequently
- Not a true solution to the quota problem

**The real solution:**
- Use `quarto publish gh-pages` command
- No artifacts at all
- Simple, official, and works perfectly on Windows

**Next step:**
- Replace `quarto-publish.win64.yml` with `quarto-publish.simple.yml`
- Configure GitHub Pages to use `gh-pages` branch
- Done! No more quota issues, ever.
