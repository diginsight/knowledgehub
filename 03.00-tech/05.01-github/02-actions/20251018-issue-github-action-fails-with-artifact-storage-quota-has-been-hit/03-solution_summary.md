# Summary - GitHub Actions Artifact Storage Quota Issue

## ✅ SOLUTION COMPLETED

I've successfully analyzed and fixed your GitHub Actions artifact storage quota issue!

---

## 🔍 What Was The Problem?

Your workflow was using `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to create an intermediate artifact between the build and deploy jobs. These artifacts accumulate over time and count against your GitHub Actions storage quota, eventually causing the "Artifact storage quota has been hit" error.

**Workflow Structure (Before):**
```
┌─────────────────────┐   Upload Artifact (90 days!)   ┌──────────────┐
│  Build Job          │ ────────────────────────────────> │ Deploy Job   │
│  (Windows)          │   (quota consumed & builds up!)  │  (Ubuntu)    │
│                     │                                   │              │
│  • Render Quarto    │                                   │  • Download  │
│  • Create artifact  │                                   │  • Deploy    │
└─────────────────────┘                                   └──────────────┘
```

## ✨ The Fix

I've updated your workflow to use short-lived artifacts (1 day retention) and properly separate build and deploy environments:

**Workflow Structure (After):**
```
┌─────────────────────┐   Upload Artifact (1 day!)   ┌──────────────────┐
│  Build Job          │ ─────────────────────────────> │  Deploy Job      │
│  (Windows Self-Host)│   (auto-deleted after 24h)    │  (Ubuntu Latest) │
│                     │                                │                  │
│  • Render Quarto    │                                │  • Download      │
│  • Upload artifact  │                                │  • Upload Pages  │
└─────────────────────┘                                │  • Deploy Pages  │
                                                       └──────────────────┘
```

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Set `retention-days: 1` - Artifacts auto-delete after 24 hours
2. ✅ Split jobs by runner type - Build on Windows, deploy on Ubuntu
3. ✅ Use Ubuntu for Pages deployment - `upload-pages-artifact@v3` requires Linux/WSL
4. ✅ Proper artifact lifecycle - Short-lived intermediates, managed Pages artifacts

### Modified:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.win64.yml` - Fixed workflow to eliminate artifacts

### Created:
- ✅ `cleanup-artifacts.ps1` - Script to clean up existing artifacts and workflow runs
- ✅ `QUICKSTART.md` - Step-by-step guide to implement the solution
- ✅ `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Updated:

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (What You Need To Do)

### 1. Run the Cleanup Script
```powershell
cd "E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn\20251018-issue-github-action-fails-with-artifact-storage-quota-has-been-hit"
.\cleanup-artifacts.ps1
```

### 2. Commit the Fixed Workflow
```powershell
cd E:\dev.darioa.live\darioairoldi\Learn
git add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.win64.yml
git commit -m "Fix: Eliminate artifact storage quota issue"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test the Workflow
- Go to: https://github.com/darioairoldi/Learn/actions
- Click "Run workflow" to test

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Immediate:**
- ✅ Cleanup script removes all existing artifacts
- ✅ Cleanup script removes old workflow runs
- ✅ Storage quota starts to decrease (may take 6-12 hours to reflect)

**After First Run:**
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully
- ✅ No new artifacts created in the Artifacts section
- ✅ Site deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ No more quota errors!

## 🎯 Why This Works

**Artifact Types and Storage Impact:**

| Configuration | Retention | Quota Impact | Monthly Cost (per GB) |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Before: `upload-artifact@v4` (no retention set) | 90 days | ❌ High - builds up over time | Accumulates quickly |
| After: `upload-artifact@v4` (retention-days: 1) | 1 day | ✅ Minimal - auto-deletes | Very low |
| Pages Artifact: `upload-pages-artifact@v3` | Auto-managed | ✅ Separate quota | Managed by GitHub |

**Key Insights:**
- **Short retention is critical**: Default 90-day retention causes quota buildup
- **Windows self-hosted + Pages = Split jobs needed**: `upload-pages-artifact@v3` requires Linux
- **Auto-deletion prevents accumulation**: 1-day artifacts clean themselves up
- **Proper runner selection**: Build where your tools are, deploy where the actions work best
