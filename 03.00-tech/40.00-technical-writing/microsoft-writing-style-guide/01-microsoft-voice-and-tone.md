## Introduction

Voice defines **how your content sounds**. Tone adjusts that voice for specific situations. Together, they determine whether readers perceive your documentation as helpful, cold, confusing, or empowering.

Microsoft's voice is **distinctive and intentional**—warmer than most technology documentation, more conversational than academic writing, yet professional enough for enterprise contexts.

This article covers:

- **Three voice principles** — The pillars of Microsoft's content personality
- **Contractions mandate** — Why "it's" isn't just acceptable but required
- **Person usage** — When to use "you," "we," and "I"
- **Bias-free communication** — Writing that includes everyone
- **Accessible language** — Content that works for all abilities

**Prerequisites:** [Microsoft Writing Style Guide Overview](00-microsoft-style-guide-overview.md) provides foundational context.

**Related:** [Writing Style and Voice Principles](../01-writing-style-and-voice-principles.md) covers general voice concepts across multiple style guides.

## The <mark>Three Voice Principles</mark>

Microsoft's voice rests on three <mark>interconnected principles</mark> that together create a distinctive, human-centered tone.

### Principle 1: <mark>Warm and Relaxed</mark>

> "We're natural. Less formal, more grounded in real, everyday conversations. Occasionally, we're fun."

**What "warm and relaxed" means:**
- Write as you'd speak to a colleague you respect
- Use conversational structures and phrasing
- Allow appropriate humor when it doesn't distract
- Avoid stiff, overly formal constructions

**Warm and relaxed in practice:**

| Cold/Formal | Warm/Relaxed |
|-------------|--------------|
| "It is necessary to configure the settings prior to deployment." | "Configure your settings before you deploy." |
| "Users should be aware that..." | "Keep in mind that..." |
| "The functionality has been deprecated." | "This feature is going away. Here's what to use instead." |
| "An error has occurred." | "Something went wrong. Let's fix it." |

**Boundaries:** Warm doesn't mean unprofessional. Avoid:
- Excessive exclamation points!!!
- Forced humor that distracts
- Overly casual language ("gonna," "wanna")
- Slang that excludes non-native speakers

### Principle 2: <mark>Crisp and Clear</mark>

> "We're to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all."

**What "crisp and clear" means:**
- Lead with the essential information
- Cut every unnecessary word
- Use simple sentence structures
- Optimize for scanners, not deep readers

**Crisp and clear in practice:**

| Verbose | Crisp |
|---------|-------|
| "In order to accomplish this task, you will need to..." | "To do this:" |
| "It is important to note that the system requires..." | "The system requires..." |
| "There are several options available for you to choose from." | "Choose an option:" |
| "At this point in time, we are currently working on..." | "We're working on..." |

**The scanning-first principle:**

Most users **scan** documentation rather than read it. Microsoft optimizes for this reality:

1. **Front-load keywords** — Put important terms at the start of sentences
2. **Use descriptive headings** — Readers should understand content from headings alone
3. **Break long paragraphs** — Walls of text discourage scanning
4. **Use lists and tables** — Structured formats are faster to scan

### Principle 3: <mark>Ready to Lend a Hand</mark>

> "We show customers we're on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time."

**What "ready to lend a hand" means:**
- Anticipate what users need next
- Provide context and next steps
- Write from the user's perspective
- Show empathy in error situations

**Ready to lend a hand in practice:**

| Unhelpful | Helpful |
|-----------|---------|
| "Error: Invalid input." | "That input isn't valid. Try a number between 1 and 100." |
| "See documentation for details." | "For details, see [Configuring authentication](link)." |
| "Operation completed." | "Your file is saved. Open it in Word to continue editing." |
| "Access denied." | "You don't have access to this folder. Ask the owner to share it with you." |

**The empathy principle:**

When things go wrong, Microsoft's voice becomes especially important:

- **Avoid blame** — Use passive voice if needed to avoid "you broke it"
- **Offer solutions** — Don't just describe the problem
- **Provide escape routes** — Give users a path forward
- **Acknowledge frustration** — "We know this is frustrating"

## <mark>Contractions: Required, Not Optional</mark>

Microsoft takes a **strong stance** on contractions: they're not just permitted—they're **required**.

### Why Contractions Matter

Contractions create conversational warmth:

| Without Contractions | With Contractions |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "It is not possible to undo this action." | "You <mark>can't undo</mark> this action." |
| "We are working to resolve the issue." | "<mark>We're working</mark> to resolve the issue." |
| "You will need to restart." | "<mark>You'll need</mark> to restart." |
| "That is the recommended approach." | "<mark>That's the recommended approach</mark>." |

### Common Contractions to Use

| Full Form | Contraction | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| it is, it has | <mark>it's</mark> | "It's ready to use." |
| you are | <mark>you're</mark> | "You're all set." |
| you will | <mark>you'll</mark> | "You'll see a confirmation." |
| you have | <mark>you've</mark> | "You've completed setup." |
| we are | <mark>we're</mark> | "We're here to help." |
| we will | <mark>we'll</mark> | "We'll fix this soon." |
| do not | <mark>don't</mark> | "Don't close this window." |
| cannot | <mark>can't</mark> | "You can't undo this." |
| will not | <mark>won't</mark> | "This won't affect your data." |
| let us | <mark>let's</mark> | "Let's get started." |

### When to Avoid Contractions

Even Microsoft makes exceptions:

- **<mark>Legal text</mark>** — Contracts, terms of service
- **<mark>Emphasis</mark>** — "Do NOT delete this file" (for critical warnings)
- **<mark>Negative contractions that could be missed</mark>** — Consider "do not" for critical actions
- **<mark>Formal announcements</mark>** — Some executive communications

### Contractions vs. Other Style Guides

| Guide | Contractions Stance |
|-------|---------------------|
| **<mark>Microsoft</mark>** | Required — use them consistently |
| **<mark>Google</mark>** | Permitted — "use them or don't" |
| **<mark>Apple</mark>** | Permitted — context-dependent |
| **<mark>AP Style</mark>** | Permitted in informal contexts |
| **<mark>Wikipedia</mark>** | Generally avoided — encyclopedic tone |
| **<mark>Academic</mark>** | Usually avoided — formal register |

## Person and Perspective

The **grammatical person** you use shapes the reader's experience. Microsoft has clear preferences.

### <mark>Second Person (You)</mark>: <mark>The Default</mark>

Microsoft strongly prefers **second person (you/your)** for most content:

> "Address the reader directly. Use 'you' to speak to the reader."

**Why "you" works:**
- Creates direct connection with reader
- Makes instructions clearer ("you do X")
- Focuses on reader's goals, not product features
- Feels more personal and engaging

**Second person in action:**

✅ **Preferred:**
> "You can customize your dashboard by adding widgets."
> "Save your work before you close the app."
> "Your data is encrypted automatically."

### <mark>First Person (We/I)</mark>: <mark>Use Sparingly</mark>

Microsoft is **cautious about first person**:

**"We" — Use only when Microsoft (the organization) is speaking:**
- "We're committed to your privacy."
- "We'll notify you when the update is ready."
- "We're working to resolve this issue."

**Avoid "we" in instructional content:**

❌ **Avoid:** "We recommend configuring two-factor authentication."
✅ **Prefer:** "Configure two-factor authentication for better security."

**"I/My" — Use only for user choices in UI:**
- ✅ Checkbox: "I agree to the terms of service"
- ✅ Toggle: "Remember my preferences"
- ✅ Option: "My account"

**Never use "I" in documentation prose.**

### <mark>Third Person</mark>: <mark>For Descriptions</mark>

Use third person when describing **systems or features objectively**:

- "The app syncs data every hour."
- "Windows Update downloads patches automatically."
- "Azure Functions scale based on demand."

### Person Summary

| Person | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **You/Your** | Instructions, guidance, addressing reader | "Save your file before closing." |
| **We/Our** | Microsoft as speaker, company commitments | "We're committed to accessibility." |
| **I/My** | UI elements representing user choice | "☑ Remember my login" |
| **Third person** | Describing systems, features | "The service processes requests." |

## <mark>Bias-Free Communication</mark>

Microsoft emphasizes **inclusive language** that respects all readers regardless of gender, ability, ethnicity, age, or background.

### <mark>Gender-Neutral Language</mark>

**Avoid gendered generics:**

| Gendered | Gender-Neutral |
|----------|----------------|
| mankind | humanity, people, humankind |
| manpower | workforce, staff, personnel |
| chairman | chair, chairperson |
| he/she (generic) | they, the user, you |
| fireman | firefighter |
| stewardess | flight attendant |

**Rewrite to avoid gendered pronouns:**

❌ **Avoid:** "When a user logs in, he sees his dashboard."

✅ **Better options:**
- "When you log in, you see your dashboard." (second person)
- "When users log in, they see their dashboards." (plural)
- "When a user logs in, they see their dashboard." (singular they)

**Microsoft explicitly endorses singular "they":**

> "It's OK to use *they* as a singular pronoun."

### <mark>Disability and Accessibility Language</mark>

**Use people-first language:**

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "the disabled" | "people with disabilities" |
| "blind users" | "users who are blind" |
| "wheelchair-bound" | "uses a wheelchair" |
| "suffers from autism" | "is autistic" or "has autism" |
| "normal users" | "users without disabilities" |

**Focus on the action, not the ability:**

❌ **Avoid:** "For users who can't see the screen..."
✅ **Prefer:** "For screen reader users..."

**Don't mention disability unless relevant:**

❌ **Unnecessary:** "A blind engineer developed this feature."
✅ **If relevant:** "Screen reader testing helped shape this feature."

### <mark>Problematic Terms to Replace</mark>

Microsoft identifies specific terms to avoid:

| Avoid | Replace With | Reason |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| <mark>master/slave</mark> | primary/replica, main/subordinate | Historical associations |
| <mark>whitelist/blacklist</mark> | allowlist/blocklist | Racial associations |
| <mark>dummy value</mark> | placeholder, sample value | Ableist connotation |
| <mark>sanity check</mark> | quick check, validation | Mental health stigma |
| <mark>crazy, insane</mark> | surprising, unexpected | Mental health stigma |
| <mark>crippled</mark> | disabled, limited | Ableist language |

### Age-Inclusive Language

- Don't assume technical ability based on age
- Avoid "digital natives" vs. "digital immigrants"
- Don't use "elderly" or "senior" as limiting descriptors

### Cultural Awareness

- Avoid idioms that don't translate ("hit it out of the park")
- Don't reference specific holidays as universal
- Use examples that work globally
- Avoid culture-specific humor

## Accessible Language

Beyond bias-free communication, Microsoft emphasizes **writing that works with assistive technologies**.

### Screen Reader Considerations

**Spell out special characters:**

Screen readers may misread symbols:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Retry +" | "Retry and add" |
| "See details ~" | "See details, approximately" |
| "A & B" | "A and B" |
| "50%" (alone) | "50 percent" (in prose) |

**Make link text descriptive:**

❌ **Avoid:** "Click [here](link) to learn more."
✅ **Prefer:** "Learn more about [configuring authentication](link)."

Screen readers often list links out of context. "Here" and "click here" are meaningless in a link list.

**Use semantic heading structure:**

- Don't skip heading levels (H1 → H3)
- Headings provide navigation landmarks
- Use heading hierarchy, not just bold text

### <mark>Cognitive Accessibility</mark>

**Write for scanners:**
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences)
- Descriptive headings
- Bulleted lists for multiple points
- Tables for comparisons

**Reduce cognitive load:**
- One idea per sentence
- Define terms on first use
- Provide context before action
- Consistent terminology throughout

### <mark>Don't Rely on Visual Cues Alone</mark>

❌ **Avoid:** "Click the red button."
✅ **Prefer:** "Click **Delete**" (or "Click the Delete button")

❌ **Avoid:** "See the options above."
✅ **Prefer:** "See [Authentication options](#authentication-options)."

**Related:** [Accessibility in Technical Writing](../03-accessibility-in-technical-writing.md) provides comprehensive accessibility guidance.

## <mark>Tone Variations by Context</mark>

While voice remains consistent, **tone adjusts** to the situation:

### <mark>Instructional Content</mark>

**Tone:** Direct, confident, efficient

> "Open Settings. Select Privacy. Choose the options that work for you."

### <mark>Error Messages</mark>

**Tone:** Empathetic, helpful, non-blaming

> "We couldn't save your file. Check your internet connection and try again."

### <mark>Marketing Content</mark>

**Tone:** Enthusiastic, inspiring, benefit-focused

> "Build apps faster than ever. Azure takes care of the infrastructure so you can focus on code."

### <mark>Legal/Compliance Content</mark>

**Tone:** Clear, precise, complete

> "Your data is stored in datacenters located in the region you selected during setup."

### <mark>Celebration/Success</mark>

**Tone:** Warm, congratulatory, forward-looking

> "Nice work! Your app is deployed. Share it with your team or keep building."

## <mark>Common Voice Pitfalls</mark>

### Pitfall 1: Stiff, Robotic Language

❌ "It is necessary to perform a restart of the application."
✅ "Restart the app."

### Pitfall 2: Hiding Behind Passive Voice

❌ "Mistakes were made in the configuration."
✅ "Check your configuration settings."

### Pitfall 3: Blaming the User

❌ "You entered an invalid email address."
✅ "That email address isn't valid. Check for typos."

### Pitfall 4: Overusing "Please"

❌ "Please click the button. Please enter your name. Please confirm."
✅ "Click the button. Enter your name. Confirm."

(One "please" is friendly. Multiple "pleases" sound desperate or passive-aggressive.)

### Pitfall 5: Jargon Without Context

❌ "Leverage the SDK to bootstrap your microservices architecture."
✅ "Use the SDK to start building your services."

### Pitfall 6: Unnecessary Words

| Wordy | Crisp |
|-------|-------|
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "For the purpose of" | "To" or "For" |
