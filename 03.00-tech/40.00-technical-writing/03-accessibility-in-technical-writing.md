## Introduction

Accessible documentation isn't optional—it's essential. When we write technical content that some users can't access, understand, or navigate, we've failed in our primary purpose: communicating information.

This article covers:

- **Plain language** - Writing that works for diverse literacy levels and non-native speakers
- **Screen readers** - Ensuring compatibility with assistive technology
- **Inclusive language** - Avoiding bias and exclusionary terminology
- **Visual accessibility** - Color, contrast, and image alternatives
- **Cognitive accessibility** - Supporting neurodivergent readers
- **Emoji accessibility** - How this repository's 📘📗📒📕 system works with assistive tech

**Legal context:** In many jurisdictions, accessible documentation is required by law (ADA, Section 508, EU Accessibility Act).

**Prerequisites:** Understanding of [writing style principles](01-writing-style-and-voice-principles.md) and [documentation structure](02-structure-and-information-architecture.md).

## Why Accessibility Matters in Documentation

### The Numbers

- **15% of the global population** has some form of disability (World Health Organization)
- **1 in 12 men** (8%) has color vision deficiency
- **Over 1 billion people** speak English as a second language
- **10-20% of the population** is neurodivergent (dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum)

### The Benefits

**Accessibility improvements benefit everyone:**

| Accessibility Feature | Primary Beneficiary | Secondary Beneficiaries |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Plain language | Non-native speakers | Everyone (faster reading) |
| Alt text for images | Screen reader users | Users on slow connections |
| Clear headings | Screen reader navigation | All users (scannability) |
| Captions for video | Deaf users | Anyone in quiet environment |
| High contrast | Low vision users | Users in bright sunlight |
| Consistent structure | Cognitive disabilities | All users (predictability) |

### The Standards

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** provides the foundation:

- **Perceivable:** Content can be perceived (seen, heard, felt)
- **Operable:** Interface can be operated by all users
- **Understandable:** Content and interface are understandable
- **Robust:** Content works with assistive technologies

Documentation should meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** at minimum.

## Plain Language Principles

Plain language makes content accessible to diverse readers including:
- People with reading difficulties
- Non-native English speakers
- Experts in other fields
- Users under time pressure

### The Plain Language Guidelines

From the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/):

**1. Write for your audience**
- Identify who reads your documentation
- Use terminology they understand
- Address their actual questions

**2. Organize information logically**
- Put important information first
- Use headings that describe content
- Break content into manageable sections

**3. Use clear sentence structure**
- Keep sentences short (15-25 words)
- Use active voice
- Place subjects near their verbs

**4. Choose words carefully**
- Prefer common words over jargon
- Define technical terms when first used
- Avoid acronyms without expansion

### Before/After: Plain Language Transformation

**Example 1: Developer documentation**

❌ **Complex:**
> "The authentication subsystem facilitates the implementation of credential verification mechanisms utilizing industry-standard protocols for the establishment of secure session contexts."

✅ **Plain language:**
> "The authentication system verifies user credentials using standard security protocols. Once verified, it creates a secure session."

**Example 2: Error message**

❌ **Complex:**
> "An irrecoverable exception has occurred during the execution of the data persistence operation due to the unavailability of required system resources."

✅ **Plain language:**
> "Cannot save data. The system ran out of memory. Close other applications and try again."

**Example 3: API documentation**

❌ **Complex:**
> "The endpoint necessitates the provision of authentication credentials in the form of a bearer token within the Authorization header of the HTTP request."

✅ **Plain language:**
> "Include your access token in the request header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`"

### Plain Language Checklist

✅ **Words**
- [ ] Used simple words when possible
- [ ] Defined technical terms on first use
- [ ] Expanded acronyms on first use
- [ ] Avoided unnecessary jargon

✅ **Sentences**
- [ ] Kept sentences under 25 words
- [ ] Used active voice (75%+ of sentences)
- [ ] Put main idea first in sentences
- [ ] Used parallel structure in lists

✅ **Structure**
- [ ] Put most important information first
- [ ] Used descriptive headings
- [ ] Broke long sections into subsections
- [ ] Used bullet lists for multiple items

## Screen Reader Compatibility

Screen readers convert visual content to audio or braille. Writing for screen readers means thinking beyond visual layout.

### How Screen Readers Process Content

**Content processed:**
- Text (read aloud or converted to braille)
- Headings (announced with level: "Heading level 2, Authentication")
- Links (announced: "Link, API Reference")
- Images (alt text read aloud)
- Lists (announced: "List, 5 items")
- Tables (row/column navigation)

**Content NOT processed or problematic:**
- Color alone (can't be perceived)
- Images without alt text (skipped or "image" announced)
- Complex tables without headers
- Semantic meaning conveyed only through visual formatting

### Heading Structure

Screen reader users navigate by headings. Proper heading hierarchy is essential.

✅ **Correct heading hierarchy:**
```markdown
# Page Title (h1 - only one per page)
## Main Section (h2)
### Subsection (h3)
### Another Subsection (h3)
## Another Main Section (h2)
```

❌ **Skipped heading levels (accessibility violation):**
```markdown
# Page Title
### Subsection (skipped h2!)
## Main Section
#### Detail (skipped h3!)
```

### Link Text

Screen readers can list all links on a page. Link text must make sense out of context.

❌ **Meaningless link text:**
> "For more information about authentication, click [here](./auth.md)."
> "Read more [here](./details.md), [here](./examples.md), and [here](./reference.md)."

✅ **Descriptive link text:**
> "For setup instructions, see the [Authentication Guide](./auth.md)."
> "See [detailed examples](./examples.md) and [API reference](./reference.md)."

### Image Alt Text

Alt text should convey the **information or function** of an image, not just describe it.

**For informative images:**
```markdown
![Diagram showing OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with three actors: 
User, Application, and Authorization Server. Arrows show: 1) User 
requests login, 2) Application redirects to Auth Server, 3) User 
authenticates, 4) Auth Server returns code, 5) Application exchanges 
code for token](./oauth-flow.png)
```

**For decorative images (empty alt):**
```markdown
![](./decorative-divider.png)
```

**For complex diagrams (long description):**
```markdown
![OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](./oauth-flow.png)

*Figure 1: OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. The user initiates login 
with the application. The application redirects to the authorization 
server...*
```

### Code Blocks

Screen readers handle code blocks but benefit from context:

```markdown
The following code shows how to initialize the client:

```python
# Initialize the API client with your credentials
client = APIClient(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",  # Required: your API key
    region="us-west"          # Optional: defaults to us-east
)
```

After initialization, you can make API calls...
```

### Tables

Tables need headers for screen reader navigation:

✅ **Accessible table:**
```markdown
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | /users   | List users  |
| POST   | /users   | Create user |
```

Screen reader announces: "Table, 2 rows, 3 columns. Row 1, Method: GET, Endpoint: /users, Description: List users."

❌ **Inaccessible table (layout table without headers):**
```markdown
| GET | /users | List all users in the system |
| POST | /users | Create a new user account |
```

## Inclusive Language

Inclusive language ensures all readers feel welcome and respected. It also improves clarity by avoiding assumptions.

### Gender-Inclusive Language

❌ **Exclusive:**
> "The developer should update his configuration."
> "Each user must enter his or her password."
> "Man the servers."

✅ **Inclusive:**
> "Developers should update their configuration."
> "Each user must enter their password." (singular they)
> "Staff the servers."

### Ability-Inclusive Language

❌ **Ableist language:**
> "Simply complete the form." (assumes simplicity for all)
> "See the diagram below." (assumes visual ability)
> "Crazy fast performance." (trivializes mental health)

✅ **Inclusive alternatives:**
> "Complete the form." (remove "simply")
> "The following diagram shows..." (acknowledges it exists)
> "Extremely fast performance." (neutral intensifier)

### Terms to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Whitelist/Blacklist | Allowlist/Blocklist | Racial neutrality |
| Master/Slave | Primary/Secondary, Leader/Follower | Historical sensitivity |
| Dummy value | Placeholder value, Sample value | Respectful language |
| Sanity check | Quick check, Validation check | Mental health sensitivity |
| Grandfathered | Legacy, Exempt | Historical sensitivity |
| Crippled | Limited, Reduced, Restricted | Disability sensitivity |
| Blind to | Unaware of, Ignoring | Disability sensitivity |

### Microsoft's Bias-Free Communication Guidelines

From the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/style-guide/bias-free-communication):

**Focus on people, not attributes:**
- ❌ "The disabled can use voice commands."
- ✅ "People with disabilities can use voice commands."

**Avoid stereotypes:**
- ❌ "Even a child could use this interface."
- ✅ "The interface is designed for users of all experience levels."

**Use parallel treatment:**
- ❌ "John, an engineer, and his assistant Mary..."
- ✅ "John, an engineer, and Mary, an analyst..."

## Visual Accessibility

Visual accessibility ensures documentation works for users with vision differences.

### Color and Contrast

**WCAG contrast requirements:**
- **Normal text:** 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Large text (18pt+):** 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **UI components:** 3:1 contrast ratio minimum

**Never rely on color alone:**

❌ **Color-only meaning:**
> "Required fields are shown in red."
> "Green indicates success; red indicates failure."

✅ **Color plus other indicators:**
> "Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*) and shown in red."
> "Success is shown with ✅ (green); failure with ❌ (red)."

### Font and Typography

**Accessible font characteristics:**
- Sufficient size (16px minimum for body text)
- Clear distinction between similar characters (Il1, O0)
- Adequate line height (1.5x font size)
- Reasonable line length (50-75 characters)

**Emphasis guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for emphasis, not UPPERCASE
- Avoid italics for long passages (harder to read)
- Don't use underlining (reserved for links)

### Image Accessibility

**Requirements:**
- Alt text for all informative images
- Empty alt (`![]()`) for decorative images
- Text alternatives for complex diagrams
- Avoid text embedded in images

**Color blindness considerations:**
- Don't rely on red/green distinction
- Use patterns or labels in addition to color
- Test diagrams with color blindness simulators

## Cognitive Accessibility

Cognitive accessibility supports users with dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum conditions, and other cognitive differences.

### Principles for Cognitive Accessibility

**1. Predictable structure**
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Same elements in same locations
- Predictable behavior (links, buttons)

**2. Reduced cognitive load**
- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences
- Break complex procedures into steps

**3. Clear language**
- Define jargon
- Avoid idioms and metaphors
- Be literal and specific

**4. Adequate time and space**
- No auto-advancing content
- Plenty of whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Writing for Dyslexic Readers

**Helpful practices:**
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences)
- Left-aligned text (not justified)
- Bulleted lists for multiple items
- Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Verdana, OpenDyslexic)
- Good contrast but not pure black on white (try dark gray #333)

**Avoid:**
- Dense blocks of text
- Long sentences with multiple clauses
- Similar-looking words in sequence

### Writing for ADHD Readers

**Helpful practices:**
- Clear, action-oriented headings
- Key information highlighted (bold, callout boxes)
- TL;DR summaries at the start
- Progress indicators in tutorials
- Visual breaks between sections

**Avoid:**
- Burying important information in paragraphs
- Long unbroken sections
- Unnecessary tangents

### Writing for Autistic Readers

**Helpful practices:**
- Literal, precise language
- Explicit instructions (don't assume)
- Consistent terminology (same word for same concept)
- Structured, predictable format
- Clear success criteria

**Avoid:**
- Idioms and metaphors ("wrap your head around")
- Ambiguous language
- Implicit expectations
- Sarcasm or humor that might be misread

## Emoji and Symbol Accessibility

This repository uses emoji markers (📘📗📒📕) for reference classification. Here's how to use symbols accessibly.

### How Screen Readers Handle Emoji

Screen readers announce emoji by their Unicode name:

- 📘 → "blue book"
- 📗 → "green book"  
- 📒 → "ledger"
- 📕 → "closed book"

**Implications for our classification system:**

Current format:
```markdown
**[Microsoft Style Guide](url)** 📘 [Official]
```

Screen reader announces: "Link, Microsoft Style Guide, blue book, Official"

**This works** because we include text labels (`[Official]`, `[Verified Community]`, etc.) alongside emoji. The emoji provides quick visual scanning; the text provides semantic meaning.

### Emoji Accessibility Guidelines

**1. Don't rely on emoji alone for meaning**

❌ **Emoji only:**
```markdown
📘 Microsoft Docs
📗 GitHub Blog
📒 Medium Article
```

✅ **Emoji plus text:**
```markdown
📘 [Official] Microsoft Docs
📗 [Verified] GitHub Blog
📒 [Community] Medium Article
```

**2. Limit emoji density**

❌ **Too many emoji:**
```markdown
🔧 Configuration ⚙️ → Settings 📁 → Options ✅
```

✅ **Selective use:**
```markdown
**Configuration** → Settings → Options ✅
```

**3. Consider cultural differences**

Some emoji meanings vary by culture. Prefer universally understood symbols or include text clarification.

### Alternative to Emoji: Text-Based Labels

If emoji cause issues, text alternatives work:

```markdown
**[Microsoft Style Guide](url)** [OFFICIAL]
**[GitHub Blog](url)** [VERIFIED]
**[Medium Article](url)** [COMMUNITY]
```

## Testing Documentation Accessibility

### Manual Testing

**Keyboard navigation:**
1. Can you Tab through all interactive elements?
2. Is the Tab order logical?
3. Are focus indicators visible?

**Screen reader testing:**
1. Read the page with a screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver)
2. Navigate by headings—does structure make sense?
3. Listen to link text—is it descriptive?
4. Check tables—are headers announced?

**Zoom testing:**
1. Zoom to 200%—does content remain usable?
2. Is horizontal scrolling avoided?
3. Do images scale appropriately?

### Automated Testing

**Tools:**
- **WAVE** - Browser extension for accessibility evaluation
- **axe DevTools** - Chrome/Firefox extension for WCAG testing
- **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools
- **Pa11y** - Command-line accessibility testing

**Limitations:**
Automated tools catch ~30% of accessibility issues. Manual testing and user feedback remain essential.
