## AI Capabilities and Limitations

Understanding what AI does well—and poorly—is essential for effective use.

### What AI Does Well

**1. <mark>First draft generation</mark>**
AI excels at producing initial drafts from outlines or specifications:
- Converts bullet points to prose
- Expands brief notes into paragraphs
- Generates standard structures (introductions, conclusions)

**2. <mark>Grammar and style improvement</mark>**
AI catches mechanical issues effectively:
- Spelling errors
- Grammar mistakes
- Awkward phrasing
- Passive voice overuse

**3. <mark>Readability enhancement</mark>**
AI can transform complex text:
- Simplify technical jargon
- Shorten long sentences
- Improve paragraph structure

**4. <mark>Format conversion</mark>**
AI handles structure transformation:
- Prose to bullet points
- Tables to prose (and vice versa)
- Markdown formatting
- Code example formatting

**5. <mark>Translation and localization</mark>**
AI provides reasonable translations:
- Draft translations (requiring review)
- Terminology consistency
- Cultural adaptation suggestions

**6. <mark>Summarization</mark>**
AI compresses information effectively:
- Executive summaries
- TL;DR sections
- Changelogs from commit history

### What AI Does Poorly

**1. <mark>Fact accuracy (critical limitation)</mark>**
AI often generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information:
- Invented API endpoints
- Non-existent configuration options
- Wrong version numbers
- Fabricated error messages

**2. <mark>Current information</mark>**
AI training has a cutoff date:
- Recent product changes unknown
- Latest best practices missed
- Current version information outdated

**3. <mark>Code correctness</mark>**
AI code examples may:
- Have syntax errors
- Use deprecated APIs
- Contain logic bugs
- Reference non-existent methods

**4. <mark>Organizational consistency</mark>**
AI doesn't inherently know your standards:
- Different formatting than house style
- Inconsistent terminology
- Mismatched voice/tone

**5. <mark>Nuanced technical judgment</mark>**
AI may miss:
- Security implications
- Performance considerations
- Edge case handling
- Context-dependent recommendations

### The Capability Matrix

| Task | AI Capability | Human Oversight Needed |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| <mark>Draft generation</mark> | High | Medium - verify accuracy |
| <mark>Grammar checking</mark> | High | Low - review changes |
| <mark>Readability improvement</mark> | High | Low - verify meaning preserved |
| <mark>Fact checking</mark> | Low | High - verify all claims |
| <mark>Code examples</mark> | Medium | High - test all code |
| <mark>Current information</mark> | Low | High - verify currency |
| <mark>Style consistency</mark> | Medium | Medium - check against guide |
| <mark>Audience appropriateness</mark> | Medium | Medium - verify fit |

## AI-Assisted Writing Workflows

Effective AI use requires thoughtful integration into existing workflows.

### Workflow 1: <mark>AI-First Draft</mark>

```
Human: Outline/spec → AI: Draft → Human: Review/verify → Human: Edit → Validate
```

**Best for:**
- New documentation from scratch
- Standard document types (README, API reference)
- Time-pressured situations

**Process:**
1. Human creates outline with key points
2. AI generates first draft from outline
3. Human verifies accuracy of all claims
4. Human edits for style, completeness
5. Standard validation process

**Key risk:** Accepting AI draft without verification introduces errors.

### Workflow 2: <mark>Human-First with AI Enhancement</mark>

```
Human: Draft → AI: Improve → Human: Review → Validate
```

**Best for:**
- Technical accuracy is paramount
- Complex or nuanced content
- When you have specific knowledge to convey

**Process:**
1. Human writes draft with full accuracy
2. AI improves grammar, readability, structure
3. Human reviews changes, accepts/rejects
4. Standard validation

**Key risk:** AI "improvements" may change meaning.

### Workflow 3: <mark>AI-Powered Review</mark>

```
Human: Draft → AI: Review → Human: Address feedback → Validate
```

**Best for:**
- Self-review augmentation
- Catching blind spots
- Scaling review capacity

**Process:**
1. Human writes complete draft
2. AI reviews against criteria (style, readability, structure)
3. Human evaluates AI feedback
4. Human makes appropriate changes
5. Standard validation

**Key risk:** Over-reliance on AI review may miss domain-specific issues.

### Workflow 4: <mark>Iterative Collaboration</mark>

```
Human: Idea → AI: Expand → Human: Refine → AI: Improve → Human: Finalize
```

**Best for:**
- Exploratory content
- Learning new topics
- Brainstorming documentation structure

**Process:**
1. Human provides initial concept
2. AI expands with suggestions
3. Human refines, adds expertise
4. AI improves presentation
5. Human finalizes with verification

**Key risk:** AI contributions may drift from accurate to plausible.

## Prompt Engineering for Documentation

Effective prompts produce better AI outputs for documentation tasks.

### Prompt Structure

**Basic structure:**
```
[Context] + [Task] + [Constraints] + [Format]
```

**Example:**
```
Context: I'm writing documentation for a Python REST API client library.

Task: Write an introduction section explaining what the library does 
and who should use it.

Constraints:
- Target audience: Python developers familiar with REST APIs
- Reading level: Technical but accessible (Flesch 50-70)
- Tone: Professional, helpful
- Length: 150-200 words

Format: Markdown with a heading level 2
```

### Documentation-Specific Prompt Patterns

**Pattern: Style guide compliance**
```
Review this text for compliance with the Microsoft Writing Style Guide. 
Focus on:
- Active voice usage
- Sentence length (target 15-25 words)
- Jargon and technical terms
- Second person (you/your) usage

Provide specific suggestions with examples.

Text:
[paste text]
```

**Pattern: Readability improvement**
```
Improve the readability of this text while preserving technical accuracy.

Target metrics:
- Flesch Reading Ease: 50-70
- Average sentence length: 15-25 words
- Active voice: 75%+

Explain each significant change.

Text:
[paste text]
```

**Pattern: Structure generation**
```
Create an outline for a how-to guide about [topic].

Requirements:
- Include prerequisites section
- Number steps clearly
- Include troubleshooting section
- Add "Next steps" section
- Follow Diátaxis how-to principles (goal-oriented, minimal explanation)
```

**Pattern: Example generation**
```
Generate a code example for [API/feature].

Requirements:
- Complete, runnable example
- Include necessary imports
- Use realistic variable names
- Add comments explaining key parts
- Show expected output
- Include error handling

Language: [Python/JavaScript/etc.]
```

### Prompts to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:**
```
Write some documentation.
```

❌ **No constraints:**
```
Explain how authentication works.
```

❌ **Assuming current knowledge:**
```
What's the latest way to do X in [product]?
```

❌ **No format guidance:**
```
Tell me about REST APIs.
```

### Prompt Templates for This Repository

**Grammar review:**
```
Review this article for grammar issues following the standards in 
documentation.instructions.md. Focus on:
- Subject-verb agreement
- Punctuation (especially with code references)
- Consistent capitalization
- Word choice

List issues with line references and suggested corrections.
```

**Reference classification:**
```
Classify these references according to the repository's system:
📘 Official - Primary vendor/institutional sources
📗 Verified Community - Reviewed secondary sources  
📒 Community - Unreviewed community content
📕 Unverified - Needs investigation

For each reference, explain your classification reasoning.
```

### Validation Task Boundaries

| Validation Type | AI Role | Human Role |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Grammar | Primary validator | Final review |
| Readability | Primary analyzer | Judgment on changes |
| Structure | Checker | Decide appropriateness |
| Coherence | Identifier | Verify logic |
| Fact accuracy | Flag for review | Verify all facts |
| Code correctness | Syntax check | Run and test |
| Currency | Cannot verify | Must verify |

### Implementing AI Validation

**Step 1: Define validation criteria**
```yaml
validation_criteria:
  grammar:
    check: spelling, punctuation, agreement
    standard: Microsoft Writing Style Guide
  readability:
    flesch_target: 50-70
    sentence_max: 25
    passive_max: 25%
  structure:
    required: [title, introduction, conclusion]
    heading_levels: [1, 2, 3] # no skipping
```

**Step 2: Create validation prompt**
```
Validate this document against the following criteria:
[paste criteria]

For each criterion:
1. State whether it passes or fails
2. Provide specific examples of issues
3. Suggest corrections

Document:
[paste document]
```

**Step 3: Human review of AI validation**
- Review AI findings
- Verify suggested corrections
- Check for false positives
- Identify missed issues

**Step 4: Track validation results**
```yaml
validation_results:
  grammar:
    status: pass
    ai_confidence: high
    human_verified: true
  readability:
    status: needs_work
    flesch_score: 45  # below target
    suggestions_applied: 3
```

## Preventing Hallucinations

Hallucinations—confident but false outputs—are AI's most dangerous failure mode for documentation.

### Why Hallucinations Happen

AI models generate text by predicting likely next tokens. They can produce:
- Plausible-sounding but invented facts
- Confident assertions about things that don't exist
- Smooth prose that reads well but is wrong

**High-risk areas for documentation:**
- API endpoints and parameters
- Version numbers and dates
- Error messages and codes
- Configuration options
- Performance numbers

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Provide source material**
```
Using ONLY the following API specification, document the /users endpoint:

[paste actual API spec]

Do not add any parameters or behaviors not specified.
```

**2. Require citations**
```
For each technical claim, indicate the source:
- [SPEC] = from provided specification
- [INFERRED] = logically derived from spec
- [ASSUMED] = not in spec, assumption made

Flag any [ASSUMED] items for human verification.
```

**3. Use verification checkpoints**
```
After generating documentation:
1. List all API endpoints mentioned
2. List all parameters with types
3. List all error codes
4. List all version numbers

I will verify each item before proceeding.
```

**4. Constrain with examples**
```
Generate documentation following EXACTLY this pattern:

## GET /resource/{id}

Retrieves a resource by ID.

### Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | yes | Resource identifier |

### Response
...

Use this pattern for the /users endpoint.
```

**5. Request uncertainty flagging**
```
If you're unsure about any technical detail:
- Mark it with [VERIFY]
- Explain why you're uncertain
- Suggest how to verify

Do not present uncertain information as fact.
```

### Verification Checklist

Before publishing AI-generated content:

- [ ] All code examples tested and working
- [ ] All API endpoints verified against actual API
- [ ] All parameter names/types verified
- [ ] All version numbers confirmed
- [ ] All error messages verified
- [ ] All links tested
- [ ] All command outputs verified
- [ ] All claims traceable to sources

## Human-in-the-Loop Patterns

Effective AI use keeps humans in meaningful control.

### Pattern: Human as Editor

```
AI generates → Human reviews and edits → Published
```

**Strengths:** Efficient, human catches AI errors
**Risks:** Review fatigue may miss errors

**Best practices:**
- Define clear review checklist
- Take breaks between reviews
- Focus review on high-risk areas
- Don't rubber-stamp

### Pattern: Human as Approver

```
AI generates → AI validates → Human approves/rejects → Published
```

**Strengths:** Two-stage validation
**Risks:** Human may trust AI validation too much

**Best practices:**
- Spot-check AI validation
- Reject uncertain items
- Maintain veto power

### Pattern: Human as Director

```
Human specifies → AI executes → Human verifies → Published
```

**Strengths:** Human controls content, AI handles execution
**Risks:** Specifications may be incomplete

**Best practices:**
- Detailed specifications
- Iterative refinement
- Verify against intent

### Pattern: Human as Collaborator

```
Human drafts → AI improves → Human adjusts → AI refines → Published
```

**Strengths:** Combines human knowledge with AI capabilities
**Risks:** May lose track of accuracy through iterations

**Best practices:**
- Verify facts at each iteration
- Track changes explicitly
- Human makes final call

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Situation | Recommended Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|
| New documentation, known topic | Human as Director |
| Improving existing docs | Human as Editor |
| High-volume, low-risk content | Human as Approver |
| Complex, nuanced content | Human as Collaborator |
| Critical technical accuracy | Human as Editor + Expert Review |

## Building Documentation Agents

AI agents can automate documentation workflows beyond simple prompts.

### What Documentation Agents Do

**Routine automation:**
- Link checking and reporting
- Readability score calculation
- Style guide compliance checking
- Change detection and flagging

**Intelligent assistance:**
- Draft generation from specs
- Review feedback aggregation
- Gap analysis
- Cross-reference validation

**Workflow orchestration:**
- Multi-step validation pipelines
- Review routing
- Publication preparation
- Update notifications

### Agent Design Principles

**1. Clear scope boundaries**
```
This agent handles:
✓ Grammar validation
✓ Readability analysis
✓ Link checking

This agent does NOT handle:
✗ Fact verification
✗ Technical accuracy
✗ Final publication approval
```

**2. Explicit uncertainty handling**
```
When confidence is below 80%:
- Flag for human review
- Explain uncertainty
- Do not auto-apply changes
```

**3. Audit trails**
```
Log all agent actions:
- What was checked
- What was changed
- What was flagged
- Confidence levels
```

**4. Human override capability**
```
All agent decisions can be:
- Reviewed by humans
- Overridden when appropriate
- Fed back for improvement
```

### This Repository's Agent Approach

**IQPilot MCP Server** (from [src/IQPilot/](../../src/IQPilot/)):

**Tools provided:**
- Grammar validation with Microsoft Writing Style Guide
- Readability analysis with target ranges
- Structure validation for required elements
- Reference classification verification
- Cross-reference validation
- Gap analysis for coverage

**Human-in-the-loop:**
- All validation results reviewed by humans
- No automatic publication
- Caching prevents unnecessary re-validation
- Metadata tracks validation history

**Validation prompts** (from [.github/prompts/](../../.github/prompts/)):
- Structured prompts for each validation dimension
- Reference established criteria
- Require human judgment for final decisions

## Ethical Considerations

AI in documentation raises ethical questions worth considering.

### Transparency

**Should you disclose AI use?**

Arguments for disclosure:
- Readers can calibrate trust
- Supports verification expectations
- Acknowledges tools used

Arguments against disclosure:
- All documentation uses tools (spell-check, etc.)
- Quality matters more than method
- May create unfounded distrust

**This repository's position:** Quality and accuracy matter more than creation method. Validation ensures quality regardless of how content was created.

### Attribution

**If AI generates content, who is the author?**

The human who:
- Directed the AI
- Verified accuracy
- Made editorial decisions
- Takes responsibility for content

**AI as tool, not author:** Like a word processor or grammar checker, AI is a tool. The human using it is responsible for output.

### Bias and Fairness

**AI may perpetuate biases:**
- Gender assumptions in examples
- Cultural assumptions in explanations
- Accessibility oversights

**Mitigation:**
- Review AI output for bias
- Use inclusive language guidelines
- Test with diverse reviewers
- Apply accessibility standards

### Accuracy Responsibility

**Humans remain responsible for accuracy:**
- AI errors are human errors (failure to verify)
- "The AI wrote it" is not an excuse
- Verification is non-negotiable

## Applying AI in This Repository

### Current AI Integration

**Writing assistance:**
- GitHub Copilot for code examples
- AI chat for drafting and improvement
- Prompt-based validation

**Validation tools:**
- IQPilot MCP server for structured validation
- Prompt files for consistent review
- Caching to avoid redundant AI calls

**Human oversight:**
- All AI output reviewed before publication
- Validation metadata tracks AI involvement
- Human makes final publication decisions

### Prompt Files

Located in [.github/prompts/](../../.github/prompts/):

**Usage pattern:**
```
Run [prompt-name].prompt on this article
```

**Available prompts:**
- `grammar-review.prompt.md`
- `readability-review.prompt.md`
- `structure-review.prompt.md`
- `fact-check.prompt.md`

### Agent Files

Located in [.github/agents/](../../.github/agents/):

**Specialized agents:**
- Documentation validation
- Reference management
- Structure generation

### Validation Workflow

```
1. Author writes/edits content
2. Author runs validation prompts
3. AI provides feedback
4. Author addresses feedback
5. Human reviewer approves
6. Content published
7. Validation metadata updated
```

### Caching Strategy

**Why cache validation:**
- AI calls can be expensive
- Unchanged content doesn't need re-validation
- Focus resources on changed content

**Cache duration:** 7 days (configurable)
**Cache invalidation:** Content hash change

## Conclusion

AI enhances documentation writing when used thoughtfully. Key principles:

**Understand AI limitations** - AI generates plausible text, not necessarily accurate text. Hallucinations are real and dangerous.

**Choose appropriate workflows** - Match AI involvement to task requirements. Higher accuracy needs demand more human involvement.

**Engineer prompts carefully** - Good prompts produce better results. Include context, constraints, and format requirements.

**Validate AI output** - AI is useful for validation but cannot be the only validator. Humans verify, especially for accuracy.

**Prevent hallucinations actively** - Provide source material, require citations, use verification checkpoints.

**Keep humans in the loop** - AI assists; humans decide. Maintain meaningful human oversight throughout.

**Consider ethics** - Transparency, attribution, bias, and accuracy responsibility matter.

**This series conclusion:**

This eight-article series has covered technical documentation from [foundations](00-foundations-of-technical-documentation.md) through AI enhancement. Key themes:

1. **Frameworks provide structure** - Diátaxis, LATCH, and validation dimensions guide decisions
2. **Style enables clarity** - Active voice, readability targets, and plain language serve readers
3. **Structure aids navigation** - Progressive disclosure, hierarchies, and cross-references help users find information
4. **Accessibility is essential** - Plain language, screen readers, and inclusive practices serve all users
5. **Code docs have standards** - API references, changelogs, and error messages follow proven patterns
6. **Validation ensures quality** - Seven dimensions, review processes, and metrics maintain standards
7. **Citations build credibility** - Source evaluation, classification, and maintenance support trust
8. **AI is a powerful tool** - When used with understanding, oversight, and verification

Documentation excellence is achievable through systematic application of these principles.
