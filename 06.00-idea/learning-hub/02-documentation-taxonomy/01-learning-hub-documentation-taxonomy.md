## Introduction

This documentation taxonomy provides a structured approach to organizing technical knowledge for learning, reference, and strategic decision-making. It applies equally to:

- **<mark>Learning Hubs</mark>** (personal) — Individual knowledge development with lower formality requirements
- **<mark>Knowledge Hubs</mark>** (shared) — Collaborative repositories requiring standardization and quality consistency

The taxonomy extends the widely-adopted <mark>**Diátaxis framework**</mark> (a documentation system that organizes content into four types based on user needs: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation) with additional content categories that address gaps in standard documentation taxonomies.

### Purpose and scope

This taxonomy defines **seven content categories** that together provide comprehensive coverage of any technical subject. These categories work for both personal Learning Hubs and shared Knowledge Hubs, with the primary difference being **quality bar** and **audience considerations**:

| Category | Purpose | User Question | Learning Hub | Knowledge Hub |
|----------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **<mark>Overview</mark>** | First-touch orientation | "What is this?" | Personal notes | Polished introduction |
| **<mark>Getting Started</mark>** | First success path | "How do I begin?" | Quick experiments | Validated tutorials |
| **<mark>Concepts</mark>** | Mental model building | "How does this work?" | Understanding notes | Authoritative explanations |
| **<mark>How-to</mark>** | Task accomplishment | "How do I do X?" | Personal procedures | Team-validated guides |
| **<mark>Analysis</mark>** | Strategic evaluation | "What approach?" | Decision journal | Comparative analysis |
| **<mark>Reference</mark>** | Authoritative lookup | "What are the specs?" | Personal cheatsheets | Accurate documentation |
| **<mark>Resources</mark>** | Supporting materials | "Where to learn more?" | Bookmark collection | Curated resource lists |

### Why extend <mark>Diátaxis</mark>?

The Diátaxis framework provides an excellent foundation with its four documentation types (Tutorial, How-to, Reference, Explanation). However, practical knowledge management—whether personal (Learning Hub) or shared (Knowledge Hub)—requires additional structure:

1. **Orientation before learning** — Users need a quick "what is this?" before committing to tutorials
2. **Layered understanding** — Complex subjects benefit from progressive depth (overview → concepts → advanced analysis)
3. **Curated discovery** — Learners need guided paths to external resources, not just internal documentation
4. **Strategic evaluation** — Technology decisions require comparative analysis beyond pure explanation
5. **Contribution pathways** — Content must be able to evolve from personal notes (Learning Hub) to shared resources (Knowledge Hub)

This taxonomy addresses these needs while maintaining compatibility with Diátaxis principles.

## Framework foundations

This taxonomy synthesizes principles from multiple established documentation frameworks. Understanding these foundations helps you apply the taxonomy effectively and adapt it when needed.

### Framework comparison

The table below compares major documentation frameworks and their approaches. For each framework:
- **Content Types** lists the document categories the framework defines
- **Philosophy** describes the core organizing principle or methodology
- **Best For** indicates where the framework excels

| Framework | Content Types | Philosophy | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Diátaxis** | 4 types (Tutorial, How-to, Reference, Explanation) | User needs along 2 axes (practical/theoretical × study/work) | General docs, open source |
| **<mark>DITA</mark>** (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) | 3 base (Concept, Task, Reference) + specializations | Topic-based authoring, XML, single-sourcing | Enterprise, localization at scale |
| **Microsoft Learn** | 8+ (Overview, Quickstart, Tutorial, Concept, How-to, Reference, Sample, Architecture) | User-centric product documentation | Product docs, learning paths |
| **Good Docs Project** | 10+ templates | Practical templates based on Diátaxis | Open source developer docs |
| **Topic-Based Authoring** | 3 (Conceptual, Procedural, Reference) | Modular, reusable topics | Foundation methodology |
| **Docs as Code** | N/A (workflow) | Git-based, CI/CD, developer collaboration | DevOps integration |

### Mapping LearnHub to standard frameworks

The table below shows how each LearnHub category corresponds to established frameworks. This mapping helps teams familiar with other systems understand where LearnHub content types fit:

| LearnHub Category | Diátaxis | Microsoft Learn | DITA |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Overview** | ≈ Explanation (intro) | Overview | Concept |
| **Getting Started** | Tutorial | Quickstart + Tutorial | Task |
| **Concepts** | Explanation | Concept | Concept |
| **How-to** | How-to | How-to | Task |
| **Analysis** | — (not addressed) | Architecture (partial) | — |
| **Reference** | Reference | Reference | Reference |
| **Resources** | — (not addressed) | Sample + links | — |

### What makes this taxonomy unique

**1. Splits Diátaxis "Explanation" into three progressive levels:**

```
Overview (orientation) → Concepts (understanding) → Analysis (evaluation)
```

This progression supports different depths of engagement:
- **Overview**: 5-minute read, decide whether to invest further
- **Concepts**: 30-minute study, build working mental model
- **Analysis**: Deep evaluation, support strategic decisions

**2. Adds "Resources" as a first-class content type:**

Most frameworks ignore curated collections. LearnHub explicitly includes:
- Examples and samples galleries
- FAQ compilations
- Migration guides
- External resource curation

**3. Expands "How-to" beyond single tasks:**

Standard How-to guides focus on immediate task accomplishment. LearnHub extends to practice development:
- Task Guides (traditional how-to)
- Patterns & Practices (reusable solutions)
- Techniques (optimization approaches)
- Methodology (complex workflow frameworks)

**4. Expands "Analysis" beyond adoption decisions:**

Rare in standard frameworks but essential for technology intelligence:
- Technology Radar classification (ADOPT/TRIAL/ASSESS/HOLD)
- Comparative analysis
- Strategy development (approach formulation)
- Trend analysis and forecasting

### DITA considerations for future scalability

While this taxonomy uses Markdown and Git-based workflows, the content structure aligns with DITA principles for potential future migration:

- **Topic-based**: Each content type maps to DITA topic types
- **Reusable**: Content can be chunked for single-sourcing
- **Structured**: Consistent patterns enable XML transformation
- **Localizable**: Clear boundaries support translation workflows

If enterprise CCMS or structured translation becomes necessary, the taxonomy provides a migration path.

## Worked example: Azure Functions

The following examples demonstrate each content type using Azure Functions as the subject. These are abbreviated samples showing structure and tone.

### Overview example

```markdown
# Azure Functions overview

> Serverless compute service for event-driven code execution

## What it is

Azure Functions is a serverless compute platform that runs code in response 
to events without requiring infrastructure management. You write functions 
in your preferred language, deploy them, and Azure handles scaling, 
availability, and maintenance.

## Key benefits

- **Pay-per-execution pricing** — No charges when code isn't running
- **Automatic scaling** — Handles load spikes without configuration
- **Language flexibility** — C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, PowerShell
- **Extensive triggers** — HTTP, timers, queues, blobs, and 20+ event sources
- **Local development** — Full debugging support in VS Code

## Who should use it

Azure Functions is ideal for:
- Event-driven processing (queue messages, file uploads)
- Scheduled tasks (data cleanup, report generation)
- API backends (lightweight REST endpoints)
- Workflow orchestration (with Durable Functions)

## When NOT to use it

Consider alternatives when:
- **Long-running processes** (>10 min) — Use Container Apps or AKS
- **Stateful applications** — Use App Service or Kubernetes
- **High-throughput, consistent load** — Reserved capacity may be cheaper
- **Complex dependencies** — Container-based hosting offers more control

## Prerequisites for learning more

- Azure subscription (free tier sufficient for learning)
- Familiarity with at least one supported language
- Basic understanding of HTTP and event-driven architecture
```

### Getting started example (Quickstart)

```markdown
# Quickstart: Create your first Azure Function

> Deploy a working HTTP function in 5 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Azure account ([create free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/))
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) installed
- VS Code with Azure Functions extension

## Create and deploy

1. **Create function project:**
   ```bash
   func init MyFunctionApp --worker-runtime python
   cd MyFunctionApp
   func new --name HttpTrigger --template "HTTP trigger"
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   func start
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTrigger?name=World`

3. **Deploy to Azure:**
   ```bash
   az login
   az functionapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --consumption-plan-location eastus \
     --name myFunctionApp --storage-account mystorageaccount \
     --runtime python
   func azure functionapp publish myFunctionApp
   ```

## Verification

You should see:
```
Functions in myFunctionApp:
    HttpTrigger - [httpTrigger]
        Invoke url: https://myFunctionApp.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger
```

- [Concepts: Understanding triggers and bindings](./concepts/triggers-bindings.md)
```

### Concepts example (Core)

```markdown
# Core concepts: Triggers and bindings

> Understand how Azure Functions connects to events and data

## Key terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Trigger** | Event that causes a function to run (exactly one per function) |
| **Binding** | Declarative connection to data (input or output, zero or more) |
| **Host** | Runtime that manages function execution and scaling |

## Core principles

**1. Functions are event-driven**

Every function has exactly one trigger that defines when it runs. 
The trigger type determines the event source: HTTP requests, queue 
messages, timer schedules, blob uploads, etc.

**2. Bindings eliminate boilerplate**

Instead of writing code to connect to services, you declare bindings 
in configuration. The runtime handles connections, serialization, 
and error handling.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    { "type": "queueTrigger", "name": "myMessage", "queueName": "input-queue" },
    { "type": "blob", "name": "outputBlob", "path": "output/{rand-guid}.txt", "direction": "out" }
  ]
}
```

**3. Stateless by design**

Functions don't maintain state between invocations. For stateful 
workflows, use Durable Functions extension.

## Common misconceptions

❌ **"Functions are always HTTP endpoints"**  
✅ HTTP is just one trigger type. Functions can respond to queues, 
   timers, database changes, and many other events.

❌ **"Serverless means no servers"**  
✅ Servers exist; you just don't manage them. Azure handles provisioning, 
   patching, and scaling.

### How-to example: Task Guide

```markdown
# How to configure Azure Functions for production

> Set up monitoring, security, and reliability for production workloads

**Subcategory:** Task Guide

## Goal

Configure an Azure Function app with production-ready settings including 
Application Insights monitoring, managed identity authentication, and 
appropriate scaling limits.

## Prerequisites

- Existing function app deployed to Azure
- Owner or Contributor role on the function app
- Azure CLI installed

## Steps

### 1. Enable Application Insights

```bash
az monitor app-insights component create \
  --app myFunctionApp-insights \
  --location eastus \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup

az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name myFunctionApp \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --settings APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY=<key-from-above>
```

### 2. Enable managed identity

```bash
az functionapp identity assign \
  --name myFunctionApp \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### 3. Configure scaling limits

```bash
az functionapp config set \
  --name myFunctionApp \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --min-tls-version 1.2 \
  --http20-enabled true
```

## Verification

1. Open Azure Portal → Function App → Application Insights
2. Confirm live metrics show incoming requests
3. Check Identity blade shows "System assigned: On"

## Troubleshooting

**Application Insights not showing data:**
- Verify APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY is set correctly
- Wait 2-3 minutes for initial data to appear
- Check function logs for instrumentation errors
```

### How-to example: Patterns & Practices

```markdown
# How to structure Azure Functions projects

> Organize functions, shared code, and configuration for maintainability

**Subcategory:** Patterns & Practices

## Goal

Establish a project structure that scales from simple apps to 
enterprise solutions with multiple function apps and shared libraries.

## When to use this pattern

- Projects with 5+ functions
- Teams with multiple developers
- Solutions requiring shared business logic
- Microservices architectures with multiple function apps

## The pattern

### Recommended folder structure

```
/src
├── FunctionApp.Api/           # HTTP-triggered functions
│   ├── Functions/
│   │   ├── UsersController.cs
│   │   └── OrdersController.cs
│   ├── host.json
│   └── FunctionApp.Api.csproj
├── FunctionApp.Workers/       # Queue/timer-triggered functions
│   ├── Functions/
│   │   ├── OrderProcessor.cs
│   │   └── CleanupJob.cs
│   └── FunctionApp.Workers.csproj
├── Shared.Core/               # Business logic (no Azure dependencies)
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Models/
│   └── Shared.Core.csproj
└── Shared.Infrastructure/     # Azure-specific implementations
    ├── Repositories/
    └── Shared.Infrastructure.csproj
```

### Key principles

1. **Separate by trigger type** — API functions vs background workers
2. **Extract shared logic** — Business rules in trigger-agnostic libraries
3. **Isolate infrastructure** — Azure SDK dependencies in dedicated project

## When NOT to use

- Simple apps with 1-3 functions (overhead not justified)
- Prototypes and POCs (structure slows iteration)
- Single-developer projects with stable requirements

## Variations

**Monorepo variant:** All function apps share single solution
**Polyrepo variant:** Each function app in separate repository with shared packages

- [How to: Configure for production](./production-config.md)
```

### Reference example

```markdown
# Configuration reference: host.json

> Complete settings reference for Azure Functions host configuration

## Overview

The `host.json` file configures the function host runtime. Settings apply 
to all functions in the app.

## Settings

### extensions

Configures behavior of trigger and binding extensions.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `http.routePrefix` | string | `"api"` | Route prefix for all HTTP functions |
| `http.maxOutstandingRequests` | int | `200` | Maximum concurrent HTTP requests |
| `http.maxConcurrentRequests` | int | `100` | Maximum parallel HTTP requests |
| `queues.batchSize` | int | `16` | Messages retrieved per poll |
| `queues.maxPollingInterval` | duration | `"00:01:00"` | Maximum polling interval |

### logging

| `logLevel.default` | string | `"Information"` | Default log level |
| `logLevel.Function` | string | `"Information"` | Function execution log level |
| `applicationInsights.samplingSettings.isEnabled` | bool | `true` | Enable telemetry sampling |

## Example

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": "api",
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 100
    }
  },

## Rationale

Azure Functions has matured into a production-ready serverless platform with:
- 5+ years of production usage across enterprises
- Active development with regular feature releases
- Strong ecosystem integration (Azure services, VS Code, GitHub Actions)
- Competitive pricing with consumption-based model

## Comparison to alternatives

| Criteria | Azure Functions | AWS Lambda | Google Cloud Functions |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Language support** | 7 languages | 7 languages | 4 languages |
| **Max execution time** | 10 min (consumption) | 15 min | 9 min |
| **Cold start** | 1-3s | 0.5-2s | 0.5-2s |
| **Azure integration** | Native | Via connectors | Via connectors |
| **Pricing** | $0.20/million executions | $0.20/million | $0.40/million |

## Recommended contexts

✅ **Use Azure Functions when:**
- Already invested in Azure ecosystem
- Event-driven, short-lived workloads
- Need rapid development with minimal infrastructure

⚠️ **Consider alternatives when:**
- Multi-cloud strategy is required
- Workloads exceed 10-minute execution limit
- Consistent high throughput (reserved capacity may be cheaper)

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Vendor lock-in | Use abstraction layers; keep business logic portable |
| Cold start latency | Premium plan with pre-warmed instances |
| Cost unpredictability | Set budget alerts; use Consumption insights |

## Trend analysis

- **Adoption:** Growing steadily in enterprise Azure environments
- **Ecosystem:** Durable Functions extension gaining traction for orchestration
- **Roadmap:** Flex Consumption (preview) addresses cold start concerns
```

### Analysis example: Strategy Development

```markdown
# Analysis: Model selection strategy for prompt engineering

> Develop an approach for choosing AI models across different use cases

**Subcategory:** Strategy Development

## Context

When building AI-powered features, selecting the right model for each 
use case significantly impacts cost, latency, and quality. This strategy 
provides a decision framework.

## Problem definition

No single model is optimal for all tasks. Different models excel at:
- Speed vs. quality trade-offs
- Reasoning depth vs. cost
- Specific domains (code, analysis, creative)

## Options considered

| Option | Approach | Trade-off |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Single model** | Use GPT-4o for everything | Simple but suboptimal |
| **Task-based selection** | Match model to task type | Better results, more complexity |
| **Tiered fallback** | Start cheap, escalate if needed | Cost-efficient, adds latency |

## Recommended approach

**Task-based selection with tiered fallback:**

| Task Type | Primary Model | Fallback |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Simple queries | GPT-4o-mini | — |
| Code generation | GPT-4o | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| Complex reasoning | o3-mini | o3 |
| Long document analysis | Claude Sonnet 4 | — |

## Decision criteria

1. **Latency requirements** — Sub-second needs eliminate reasoning models
2. **Accuracy requirements** — High-stakes decisions justify o3 costs
3. **Context length** — Documents >100K tokens need Claude or Gemini
4. **Domain specificity** — Some models excel at code, others at analysis

## When to revisit

- New model releases from major providers
- Significant pricing changes
- Observed quality issues in production
- Quarterly review cycle

## Subject folder template

When documenting a subject comprehensively, use this folder structure:

```
[Subject Name]/
├── 00-overview.md              # First-touch orientation
├── 01-getting-started/
│   ├── quickstart.md           # 5-minute path
│   └── tutorial.md             # Full learning journey
├── 02-concepts/
│   ├── 01-core-concepts.md     # Fundamental understanding
│   ├── 02-architecture.md      # System design and components
│   └── 03-advanced-topics.md   # Deep dives, edge cases
├── 03-howto/
│   ├── common-task-1.md        # Task-focused guides
│   ├── common-task-2.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md      # Problem-solution pairs
├── 04-analysis/
│   ├── technology-radar.md     # Adoption recommendations
│   ├── comparison.md           # Side-by-side analysis
│   └── strategy.md             # Implementation planning

│   └── glossary.md             # Term definitions
└── 06-resources.md             # Optional: curated links, samples
```

### Naming conventions

- **Folders:** Numbered prefixes (00-, 01-) for ordering
- **Files:** Kebab-case for URL-friendliness
- **Titles:** Sentence case in document headers

### When to use files vs. folders

| Content Volume | Approach |
|----------------|----------|
| Simple subject (< 10 pages) | Single folder with flat files |
| Medium subject (10-30 pages) | Subfolders for concepts, howto, reference |
| Complex subject (30+ pages) | Full template with all subfolders |

## Validation integration strategy

Each content type maps to specific validation dimensions. This section defines the strategy; implementation of prompts and agents follows separately.

### Validation dimensions by content type

The table below maps each content type to its validation priorities. For each content type:
- **Primary Focus** indicates the most critical validation dimension
- **Secondary Focus** lists additional important checks
- **Special Considerations** notes type-specific requirements

| Content Type | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus | Special Considerations |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Overview** | Clarity, completeness | Readability (Flesch 60-70) | Must answer "why care?" |
| **Getting Started** | Accuracy (steps must work) | Logical flow, gap analysis | Every step must be testable |
| **Concepts** | Logical coherence, completeness | Understandability | Analogies must be accurate |
| **How-to: Task Guides** | Fact accuracy, step completeness | Troubleshooting coverage | Commands must be tested |
| **How-to: Patterns** | Example quality, applicability | When to use / not use | Multiple examples required |
| **How-to: Techniques** | Measurable improvement claims | Trade-off documentation | Before/after evidence |
| **How-to: Methodology** | Completeness, decision guidance | Adaptability notes | Must cover branching paths |
| **Reference** | Exhaustive accuracy, consistency | Format compliance | Must mirror actual system |
| **Resources** | Link validity, currency | Classification accuracy | Review dates required |
| **Analysis: Technology Radar** | Source quality (📘📗 preferred) | Balanced perspective | ADOPT/TRIAL/ASSESS/HOLD required |
| **Analysis: Comparative** | Criteria clarity, fairness | Recommendation strength | Must include alternatives |
| **Analysis: Strategy** | Decision criteria, reasoning | Implementation notes | Revisit triggers required |
| **Analysis: Trends** | Evidence currency, sources | Prediction rationale | Must date predictions |

### Quality thresholds

| Dimension | Minimum Score | Target Score |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Grammar | 90% | 95%+ |
| Readability (Flesch) | 50 | 60-70 |
| Structure | 85% | 95%+ |
| Fact accuracy | 95% | 100% |
| Link validity | 100% | 100% |

### Future implementation needs

| Component | Purpose | Priority |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Content type detection prompt | Identify document type and subcategory for appropriate validation | High |
| Per-type creation prompts | Guide authors in creating each content type and subcategory | High |
| Per-type validation prompts | Check against type-specific and subcategory requirements | Medium |
| Gap analysis agent | Identify missing content types for a subject | Medium |
| Template generator prompt | Scaffold new subject documentation with subcategory templates | Low |
