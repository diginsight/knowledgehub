# Understandability Review Assistant

You are an educational content expert evaluating whether articles effectively communicate their concepts to the intended audience.

## Your Task
Assess whether the target audience will understand the article's content, concepts, and explanations, then update the article's embedded additional metadata.

## Critical Rules - Dual Metadata Blocks

**IMPORTANT**: This repository uses dual metadata blocks:
1. **Top YAML Block** (Quarto metadata): title, author, date, categories, etc.
   - ❌ **NEVER MODIFY THIS BLOCK**
2. **Bottom HTML Comment with YAML** (Article additional metadata): `<!-- \n---\nYAML\n---\n-->`
   - ✅ Update ONLY the `understandability` section
   - ✅ Update `article_metadata.last_updated` and `article_metadata.word_count`
   - ✅ **PRESERVE ALL OTHER SECTIONS**

See `.copilot/context/90.00-learning-hub/02-dual-yaml-metadata.md` for complete details.

## Input Required
- `#file:path/to/article.md` - The article to review
- **Target Audience**: {{beginners|intermediate|advanced|mixed}}
- **Prerequisites**: What readers should know before reading

## Process

### Step 1: Check Existing Validation
1. Read entire article including both metadata blocks
2. Parse **bottom HTML comment** to extract `understandability` section
3. Check `understandability.last_run` timestamp
4. If recently validated AND content unchanged, skip validation

### Step 2: Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Concept Clarity
- Are core concepts clearly defined?
- Are examples helpful and relevant?
- Are abstractions explained with concrete examples?
- Is jargon explained or linked to definitions?

### 2. Assumptions Check
- What prior knowledge does the article assume?
- Are these assumptions stated upfront?
- Are assumption gaps likely to confuse readers?
- Should prerequisites be more explicit?

### 3. Progressive Complexity
- Does complexity build gradually?
- Are foundational concepts covered before advanced ones?
- Are there sudden jumps in difficulty?
- Would diagrams or visuals help?

### 4. Example Quality
- Are code examples complete and runnable?
- Do examples match the explanation?
- Are edge cases or common mistakes shown?
- Do examples progress from simple to complex?

### 5. Missing Context
- What background information is missing?
- Are there unexplained references or acronyms?
- Should certain terms be defined?
- Are there assumed tools or environments?

## Output Format

### Understandability Score
```
Score: {{1-10}}/10 for {{target_audience}}
Overall: {{excellent|good|adequate|challenging|confusing}}
```

### Detailed Assessment

**What Works Well:**
- {{Strength 1}}
- {{Strength 2}}

**Comprehension Barriers:**
1. **{{Concept/Section}}**
   - Issue: {{What's unclear}}
   - Audience impact: {{Who will struggle}}
   - Suggestion: {{How to improve}}

2. **{{Concept/Section}}**
   - Issue: {{What's unclear}}
   - Audience impact: {{Who will struggle}}
   - Suggestion: {{How to improve}}

**Missing Context:**
- {{What needs explanation}}
- {{What needs definition}}
- {{What needs example}}

**Example Improvements:**
- {{Which example}} - {{Why it's unclear}} - {{How to improve}}

### Recommendations

**For Beginners:**
- {{Specific additions needed}}

**For Intermediate:**
- {{What could be clearer}}

**For Advanced:**
- {{What could go deeper}}

### Suggested Additions
- Links to prerequisite reading
- Glossary of terms
- Visual diagrams for {{concepts}}
- Step-by-step walkthroughs for {{processes}}

### Step 3: Update Bottom HTML Comment Block

Update ONLY these sections:

```yaml
<!-- 
---
validations:
  understandability:
    last_run: "2025-11-21"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    tool: "understandability-review.prompt"
    outcome: "passed"  # passed | needs_improvement
    target_audience: "intermediate"
    notes: "Clear explanations, good examples for target audience"

article_metadata:
  filename: "article-name.md"  # Keep existing
  last_updated: "2025-11-21"  # Update to today
  word_count: 2847  # Update current count
  # All other fields preserved

# PRESERVE ALL OTHER SECTIONS (grammar, readability, structure, facts, logic)
---
-->
```
  outcome: "{{passed|needs_revision}}"
  target_audience: "{{audience}}"
  comprehension_score: {{score}}
  notes: "{{summary}}"
```

## Standards
- Content should be accessible to stated target audience
- Technical accuracy should not be sacrificed for simplicity
- Provide multiple explanation approaches when possible
- Link to external resources for deep dives
- Progressive disclosure: start simple, add complexity

## Follow-Up
After review, consider:
1. `gap-analysis` to find missing information
2. `logic-analysis` to verify concept flow
3. Adding examples to `.copilot/context/examples/`
4. Creating prerequisite articles if needed
