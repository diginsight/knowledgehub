- Background processes use GPT-4o Mini for query refinement without counting against usage
- Full prompt logging available in output channel for debugging and optimization

**Demo Summary:**
Showed adding Cerebras API key, selecting models with different capabilities, and building a complete VS Code product website using DeepSeek v3.2 via Cerebras - all in real-time with impressive speed.

#### Language Models Editor

New centralized interface for managing all available language models:

- **Model visibility toggling** - Hide unused models from picker for cleaner interface
- **Add models from installed providers** - Activate additional providers without leaving editor
- **Search and filter capabilities**:

  - Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`
- **Grouping options** - Organize by provider or visibility status
- **Model information** - Context size, capabilities, billing details at a glance

Access via model picker in chat or Command Palette: "Chat: Manage Language Models"

**Quotes:**
> "Each time you add a model to copilot, you take the pool of GPUs that are available and have to divide them... that makes it really really hard for us to provide everything."

**Resources mentioned:**
- GitHub Copilot Free tier for getting started
- Cerebras for ultra-fast inference
- Model provider marketplace

### [39:28] Topic 4: HuggingFace Integration

**Speaker:** Celina Hanouti (Hugging Face Engineer)

**Key Points:**
- <mark>HuggingFace Inference Provider</mark> extension brings state-of-the-art open-weights models to VS Code
- One API provides access to multiple inference providers (Cerebras, Groq, Fireworks, etc.)
- No vendor lock-in - automatic provider selection for cost and speed optimization
- "Fastest" mode selects highest-performance provider; "cheapest" mode optimizes for cost
- Can filter models by provider to see all models served by specific backends
- Typical feature implementation costs ~20-30 cents with models like GLM-4.6
- Extension releases independently of VS Code for faster iteration

**Demo Summary:**
Installed HuggingFace provider extension, authenticated with access token, and used GLM-4.6 to implement a real GitHub issue for the HuggingFace Hub Python SDK using local agent mode.

**Quotes:**
> "The extension being outside of VS Code allows us to iterate faster add new features integrations bug fixes and all of that without relying on on VS Code releases."

  2. Review fetched content before use (prevents prompt injection)
- **Robust fetch tool** - Handles dynamic JavaScript content:
  - Works with Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
  - Waits for JavaScript execution before retrieving content
  - Returns actual browser-rendered content, not just HTML skeleton
- **Text Search in ignored files** - Search `node_modules`, build outputs with hints to agent

  - Title control showing current chat
  - Optional welcome banner (configure via settings)
  - Restore previous session on restart (configurable)
- **Sensitive file diffs** - Visual diff preview for `settings.json`, `package.json` edits before approval
- **Collapsible sections** (Experimental):

### [01:04:59] Topic 6: SQL Python Driver GA Release

**Speaker:** David Levy (SQL Server Product Manager)

**Key Points:**
- First <mark>first-party Python driver from Microsoft for SQL Server</mark>
- Single-line `pip install` with no dependencies makes sharing easy
- **Active Directory Default authentication** works on Mac via VS Code token sharing
- No need for repeated authentication prompts - integrates with Azure Resources extension
- Context managers (`with` statements) handle connection cleanup automatically
- Works with UV tool for virtual environment management
- UV automatically creates venv and installs dependencies on first `uv run` command
- Jupyter notebook support ideal for runbooks and troubleshooting documentation

**Roadmap Features:**
- **BCP streaming** for bulk data loading (coming in future release)
- **SQL Alchemy compatibility** - Near-complete, final fixes shipping soon
- **Streamlit integration** - Quick start available for rapid prototyping

**Demo Summary:**
Ran Python script using UV that automatically created virtual environment, connected to Azure SQL via Active Directory default auth, and displayed results in rich tables. Then showed Jupyter notebook creating Pandas dataframes and visualizations from SQL queries.

**Quotes:**
> "We spent a lot of time doing making this work. The trick is you need to be logged in as your entry authentication account... you use an extension like Azure resources, you add that extension, you connect it to your Azure account and then you have VS Code authentication."

**Resources mentioned:**
- [aka.ms/mssql-python](https://aka.ms/mssql-python) - Main landing page
- GitHub repository with quick starts, documentation wiki
- UV tool for Python package management
- Streamlit quick start for rapid prototyping

## Main Takeaways

1. **Unified Agent Architecture**
   - VS Code now provides seamless transitions between local, background (work tree isolated), and cloud (PR-based) agent execution
   - Enables new workflows where planning, implementation, and PR creation happen across different execution contexts
   - This represents a fundamental shift in how developers interact with AI assistants

2. **Model Democratization**
   - Bring-your-own-key and provider extensions (HuggingFace) give developers access to cutting-edge models immediately
   - Cost and speed optimization features help navigate the growing model landscape
   - VS Code maintains open-source principles while providing commercial GitHub Copilot integration

3. **MCP as Standard Protocol**
   - MCP 1.0 maturity brings production-ready features (tasks, sampling, elicitation)
   - VS Code's complete implementation positions it as the reference MCP client
   - Custom MCP servers enable domain-specific AI capabilities without core product changes

4. **Developer Experience Focus**
   - Authentication integration (Azure resources token sharing for SQL)
   - Virtual environment automation (UV integration)
   - Visual polish (custom icons, thinking token display, progress notifications)

## Questions Raised

1. **Q:** Does the team use VS Code to build VS Code?
   - **A:** Yes, entire team runs VS Code Insiders non-stop with pre-release extensions for continuous self-hosting
   - **Status:** Answered

2. **Q:** Do BYOK models count against GitHub Copilot quota?
   - **A:** No, but active Copilot subscription still required for background operations (commit messages, rename suggestions) that use GPT-4o Mini
   - **Status:** Answered

3. **Q:** Can custom MCP servers use tools from other MCP servers?
   - **A:** Not yet - sampling with tool calls is in the spec but not yet implemented in VS Code (coming in next release)
   - **Status:** Feature request tracked on GitHub

4. **Q:** Can BYOK models be used with cloud/background agents?
   - **A:** Yes, confirmed working with cloud agents; most users prefer local agents for interactive workflows
   - **Status:** Answered

### [01:44] Kai on 2024 Transformation
```
It's like mindblowing as a year, right? When you think about it, we didn't even have 
any agentic experience at the beginning of the year, right? We we didn't have NES, 
you know, next edit suggest and tap tap tap, right? So, yeah, a lot of things have 
changed, right? And when you think about this, right, we started without now we 
actually at the, you know, we we have a really good agent experience now, right?
```

### [50:25] Connor on MCP Evolution
```
One thing that you see is um uh like recently we we improved how we deal with uh 
uh with resources. And so um um MCP tools uh can return resources which which you 
can like see attached now to the tool call and you can also download those. This 
just returned basically a like a a JSON blob here. But um I'll do more with that 
in a minute.
```

### [1:07:15] David on Python Driver Philosophy
```
We really emphasized on sharability. You know, being able to collaborate with your 
co-workers or share a script with business users. So, we made sure that our driver 
installs with a single line pip install makes it very very easy to share with other 
users. It also makes it very easy to deploy it.
```
